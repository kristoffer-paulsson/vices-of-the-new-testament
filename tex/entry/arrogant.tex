(\textit{authadēs}):
According to Bauernfeind (TDNT 1:508--9), it denotes ``The critical judgement \ldots of the egocentric attitude, which as such necessarily leads to arrogance,'' denotes further ``In the two passages in which \emph{authades} occurs in the NT the reference is to human impulse violating obedience to the divine command. In both cases it is religious leaders who are exposed to this danger or succumb to it.'' \emph{Arrogance} defines as ``the quality of being unpleasantly proud and behaving as if you are more important than, or know more than, other people.''\cdfoot{arrogance}{2023-03-12}
