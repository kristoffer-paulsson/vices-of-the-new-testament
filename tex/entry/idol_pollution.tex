Liddell calls \grc{ἀλίσγημα} \emph{pollution}, and the cognate \grc{ἀλισγέω} ``pollute,'' while other relating words are completely false cognates. Elsewhere in the bible it is only used twice. Daniel decided in his heart that he didn't want to be polluted by the food and wine given by the king of Babylon (Dan 1:8), further, Malachi orates prophetically that the people puts polluted bread/food on his altar and despise his table (Mal 1:7, 12). Mostly it is about what comes from the altar of idolatry, what is sacrificed to demons, it is food only and grace kicks in here according to 1~Cor 10.

Found in Acts 15:20.
