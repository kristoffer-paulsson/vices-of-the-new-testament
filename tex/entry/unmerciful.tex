(\textit{aneleēmōn}):
Both Liddell and Thayer agree in the meaning \emph{merciless}, \emph{without mercy}, while Gingrich and Bultmann\bkfoot{\grc{ἀνελεήμων}}{2:487}{\tdntBultmann{}} connotes \emph{unmerciful}. It seems that \emph{merciful} purposes for active merciful conduct while merciless points at lack of compassion related to cruel conduct. While \emph{unmerciful} aims at holding back merciful conduct, thereby skipping over the poor and needy. \emph{Merciful} defines as ``someone who is merciful is willing to be kind to and forgive people who are in their power.''\cdfoot{merciful}{2023-03-11}
