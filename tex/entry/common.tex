(\textit{koinos}):
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich, including Grundmann (TDNT 3:789) agree in \emph{common}. However, generally, a good term when used in the Kingdom of God but derogatory when in the world. In a sinful context only, to be communized in the world before judgment day, they should not enter into the gates of Heavenly Jerusalem.
Found in Rev 21:27.
