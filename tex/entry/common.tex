(\textit{koinos}):
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich, including Grundmann\bkfoot{\grc{κοινός}}{3:789}{\tdntGrundmann{}}, agree on \emph{common}. Generally, it is always a term in the positive sense when used in the Kingdom of God but negatively when used in the world. In an eschatological context, it is a sin for someone to be ``shared in common'' with the world. Those will not enter the gates of Heavenly Jerusalem.
Found in Rev 21:27.
