\grc{φαρμακεία}

(\textit{pharmakeia}):
Generally, Thayer, Danker, and Gingrich agree with Liddell on the magic part of \grc{φαρμακεία}. Then analyzing the cognates thereof in L. gives a whole picture of what \grc{φαρμα-} means. Firstly \grc{φαρμακεία} means ``the use of \emph{drugs}, \emph{potions}, \emph{spells}, \ldots poisoning, \emph{witchcraft}, \ldots remedy, cure. [italicized on purpose]'' Also, ``use of \emph{drugs}, esp. of purgatives, \ldots emetics, Arist.Pr.962a3; of \emph{abortifacients}, \ldots generally, the use of any kind of \emph{drugs}, \emph{potions}, or \emph{spells}, \ldots poisoning or \emph{witchcraft}, \ldots metaph., remedy. [italicized on purpose]'' Following cognates: \grc{φαρμακάω} ``to suffer from the effect of poison, to be ill or distraught,'' \grc{φαρμακεύς} ``a poisoner, sorcerer,'' \grc{φαρμακεύω} ``to administer a drug, \ldots to use enchantments, \ldots to use it as a charm to calm the river, \ldots to drug, give him a poisonous or stupefying drug,'' \grc{φαρμακίς} ``a sorceress, witch,'' \grc{φάρμακον} ``a drug, medicine, \ldots medicine for it, remedy against it, \ldots for a head-ache, \ldots in bad sense, an enchanted potion, philtre, so a charm, spell, enchantment, \ldots also a drug, poison, \ldots .a remedy, cure, \ldots of a bridle, \ldots a remedy against,'' \grc{φαρμακοποσία} ``drinking of medicine, \ldots drinking of poison,'' \grc{φαρμακοπώλης} ``a dealer in drugs,'' \grc{φαρμακοτρίβης} ``one who grinds drugs or colors,'' \grc{φαρμακόω} ``to endue with healing power,'' \grc{φαρμακώδης} ``of the nature of a \grc{φάρμακον}, medicinal, \ldots poisonous,'' \grc{φαρμάσσω} ``to treat by using \grc{φάρμακα}, \ldots to heal or relieve by medicine, \ldots to bewitch by potions or philtres: hence to bewitch by flattery;'' In the day and age of the Greeks it was hard to tell the difference between magic and what is to be considered modern day medicine, therefore they confluenced with each other. In Gen 1:29 God gave herbs for food for humans and animals, which may kind as remedies or cures. The focus is on the evil use, that is, the use of \emph{drugs} (not medicine), \emph{potions} (magical), and the use of \emph{spells}, and \emph{abortifacients}, which sums up \emph{witchcraft}.
