(\textit{typhoō}):
Thayer denotes ``properly, \emph{to raise a smoke}, \emph{to wrap in a mist}; used only metaphorically:  1. \emph{to make proud}, \emph{puff up with pride}, \emph{render insolent}; passive, \emph{to be puffed up} with haughtiness or pride.'' Then, Gingrich denotes: \emph{be puffed up}, \emph{be conceited}. Also, a range of cognates from Liddell goes: \grc{τύφω} \emph{raise a smoke}, \emph{consume in smoke}, \emph{burn slowly}, \emph{smolder}; \grc{τυφόω} \emph{delude}, \emph{to be crazy}, \emph{demented}, \emph{rendered vain}, \emph{filled with insane arrogance}; \grc{τῦφος} \emph{vapor}, \emph{conceit}, \emph{vanity}; \grc{τυφογέρων} \emph{silly old man}, \emph{dotard}; \grc{τυφομανία} \emph{delirium}, \emph{mad delusion}; \grc{τυφοπλαστέω} \emph{invent a falsehood}, \emph{deceiving} himself; \grc{τυφοποιέω} \emph{construct an imaginary world}; \grc{τυφώδης} a person in fever, \emph{delirious}. A lot is mentioned about fever but being puffed up doesn't seem like normal pridefulness instead it seems to be a puffed-up delirious ego of vanity. \emph{Vanity} defines as ``used to describe something that is done with the aim of getting praise, fame, or approval rather than for serious or good reasons,''\cdfoot{vanity}{2023-03-24} and \emph{egocentric} as ``thinking only about yourself and what is good for you,''\cdfoot{egocentric}{2023-03-24} else \emph{conceited} as ``too proud of yourself and your actions and abilities,''\cdfoot{conceited}{2023-03-24} and \emph{egomaniacal} as ``relating to someone who considers themselves to be very important and able to do anything that they want.''\cdfoot{egomaniacal}{2023-03-24}
