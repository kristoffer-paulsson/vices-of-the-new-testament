Liddell describes ``\emph{one who slays his father, a patricide}.'' \emph{Patricide} defines as ``the crime of killing your own father''\cdfoot{patricide}{2023-03-08} If anyone kills their father, they have committed murder. If anyone kills their parent, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the thing, including proven sound before the congregational elders.
Found in 1~Tim 1:9.
