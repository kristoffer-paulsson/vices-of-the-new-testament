(\textit{epheuretēs kakos}):
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree that \grc{ἐφευρετής} means both \emph{inventor}, as well as \emph{contriver}. Then \grc{κακός} means \emph{maleficent}. \emph{Inventor} is defined as ``someone who has invented something or whose job is to invent things,''\cdfoot{inventor}{2023-03-19} and \emph{contrive} is defines ``to arrange a situation or event, or arrange for something to happen, using clever planning.''\cdfoot{contrive}{2023-03-19} Technically we are talking about persons, which are maleficent, trying to invent harm and evil, and making it come true, wickedness personified in human beings. See \entref{malevolence}, also \entref{maleficent eye}.
