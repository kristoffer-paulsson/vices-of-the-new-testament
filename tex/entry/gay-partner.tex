(\textit{arsenokoitēs}):
Thayer connotes ``(\grc{ἄρσην} a male; \grc{κοίτη} a bed), one who lies with a male as with a female, a sodomite.'' Technically this is about man-gay sex, but it seems that it can interpret differently if the combining words are more deeply understood. See \entref{nests} (multiple) to connote the word \grc{κοίτη} as singular, generally about cohabiting. Generally speaking, it is two men, a husband being sexually cohabited with a male, technically gay partnership. \emph{Civil partnership} defines as ``in the UK, a legal relationship between two people of the same sex that gives them the same rights as people who are married.''\cdfoot{civil partnership}{2023-03-10} Also, \emph{partner} as ``the person you are married to or living with as if married to them, or the person you are having a sexual relationship with.''\cdfoot{partner}{2023-03-11}
