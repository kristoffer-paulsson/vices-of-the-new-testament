(\textit{arsenokoitēs}):
Thayer connotes ``(\emph{arsēn} a male; \emph{koitē} a bed), \emph{one who lies with a male as with a female}, \emph{a sodomite}.'' Technically this is about man-gay sex, but it seems that it can interpret differently if the combining words are more deeply understood. See \entref{nests} (multiple) to assert that the word \grc{κοίτη} as singular usually is about cohabiting for multiple humans. Generally speaking, it is two men, a husband being sexually cohabited with a male, technically gay partnership. \emph{Civil partnership} defines as ``in the UK, a legal relationship between two people of the same sex that gives them the same rights as people who are married.''\cdfoot{civil partnership}{2023-03-10} Also, \emph{partner} as ``the person you are married to or living with as if married to them, or the person you are having a sexual relationship with.''\cdfoot{partner}{2023-03-11}
