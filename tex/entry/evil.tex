(\textit{ponēria}):
First we need to understand \grc{πονηρός}, according to Harder, which denotes ``The original verb is \emph{penomai} from which come \emph{penia} `poverty' and \emph{penēs}, \emph{penichros} `poor,' `needy' \ldots Related to \emph{ponos}, it has throughout class. Gk. the original sense 1. `laden with care,' `sorrowful,' `unhappy.' \ldots `laden with the exercise and care of rule.' \ldots 2. Then \emph{ponēros} denote `that which causes trouble and brings sorrow.' \ldots  `speech which brings disaster,' \ldots  `trouble which brings evil,' \ldots 3. \emph{ponēros} thus take the sense of `pitiable,' `incompetent,' `wretched,' `poor.' It can also mean `badly contrived,' `in poor shape,' `unattractive,' `unfit,' `unserviceable,' `pernicious, \ldots `unfavorably disposed,' \ldots `politically useless,' the `parasite on the commonwealth,' even the `enemy of state.' \ldots `morally reprehensible' \ldots `willingly and knowingly bad.' \ldots `full of trouble,' `unfortunate' \ldots `useless,' `false,' `wrong,' `harmful,' `unfavorable,' `offensive,' thus `deceptive.' \ldots Naturally there is a general use of \emph{ponēros} in the moral sense for `morally reprehensible,' `useless,' `bad,' `evil.' \ldots When \emph{ho ponēros} is used for the devil, it is based on NT usage.''\bkfoot{\grc{πονηρός}}{6:546--9}{\tdntHarder{}}
Then built upon this, the understanding of \grc{πονηρία} connotes as (p. 563) ``\emph{ponēria} is the `intentionally practiced evil will,' \ldots in contrast to conduct \ldots `unceasing baseness' is \emph{mochthēria}, moral uselessness \ldots Similarly \emph{ponēria} is to be distinguished from \emph{agnoia} and \emph{abelteria} `stupidity.' \emph{ponēria} affects others, \emph{abelteria} only the one who acts. The original social signification of the term \ldots may be discerned here. Its essential future acc. to Demetrius \ldots us that it is always out for gain --- something which may still be seen in the NT use.''\bkfoot{\grc{πονηρία}}{6:563}{\tdntHarder{}}
Therefore \grc{πονηρία} is nothing but utter evil. \emph{Evil} defines as ``something that is very bad and harmful.''\cdfoot{evil}{2023-03-23}
