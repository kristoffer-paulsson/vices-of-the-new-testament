(\textit{kōmos}):
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich basically agree on \emph{revelry} and \emph{carousal}. By analyzing the contexts given in L. it's found: ``\grc{ὅσος ἦν ἐν τῷ ἄστεϊ σῖτος καὶ ἑωυτοῦ καὶ ἰδιωτικός, τοῦτον πάντα συγκομίσας ἐς τὴν ἀγορὴν προεῖπε Μιλησίοισι, ἐπεὰν αὐτὸς σημήνῃ, τότε πίνειν τε πάντας καὶ} \underline{\grc{κώμῳ}} \grc{χρᾶσθαι ἐς ἀλλήλους.}'' translated as ``he brought together into the marketplace all the food in the city, from private stores and his own, and told the men of Miletus all to \underline{drink and celebrate} [emphasis added] together when he gave the word,'' from 3Hdt.1.21. Contextually a negotiator offers a truce, then collects everything eatable and drinkable for a big public festivity doing an official saying. ``\grc{νόμους δὲ καὶ ψηφίσματα λεγόμενα ἢ γεγραμμένα οὔτε ὁρῶσιν οὔτε ἀκούουσι: σπουδαὶ δὲ ἑταιριῶν ἐπ᾽ ἀρχὰς καὶ σύνοδοι καὶ δεῖπνα καὶ σὺν αὐλητρίσι} \underline{\grc{κῶμοι}},'' translates as ``and the strivings of political clubs after public offices, and meetings, and banquets, and \underline{revelings} [emphasis added] with chorus girls'' from Pl.Tht.173d. Contextually a poem or so about the majesty of a great city with its revellings and beautiful flute-girls. ``\grc{οἶμαι γὰρ τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο ἑορταὶ γίγνονται παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς καὶ} \underline{\grc{κῶμοι}} \grc{καὶ θάλειαι καὶ ἑταῖραι καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα πάντα, ὧν ἂν Ἔρως τύραννος ἔνδον οἰκῶν διακυβερνᾷ τὰ τῆς ψυχῆς ἅπαντα,}'' translates as ``for, I take it, next there are among them feasts and carousals and \underline{revelings} [emphasis added] and courtesans and all the doings of those whose souls are entirely swayed by the indwelling tyrant Eros,'' from Id.R.573d. Contextually a fest to Eros with diverse celebration, indwelling of a tyrant as demon possession together with, among others, temple-prostitutes. ``\underline{\grc{κωμάζει}} \grc{γὰρ ἡ πόλις πᾶσα τῇδε τῇ νυκτί,}'' translates partially ``in view of the \underline{revelry} [emphasis added], it would not be at all surprising if the gates leading to the palace were open, for all the city is feasting this night,'' from X.Cyr.7.5.25. Contextually there is ongoing revelry in the palace, and the whole city is feasting all night. In total \grc{κῶμος} is a festivity that builds on making pacts jointly with feasting and carousal publicly where the whole city is involved. That is an occult public celebration of a pact, or an occult covenant, which is statewide. Often sensuality and maybe even prostitution is common, especially with \emph{hetairas} temple prostitutes. \emph{Revel} defines as ``to dance, drink, sing, etc. at a party or in public, especially in a noisy way,''\cdfoot{revel}{2023-03-21} and \emph{festival} as ``a special day or period, usually in memory of a religious event, with its own social activities, food, or ceremonies.''\cdfoot{festival}{2023-03-21}
Found in Gal 5:21; 1~Pet. 4:3.
