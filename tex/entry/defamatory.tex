(\textit{loidoros}):
According to Hanse (TDNT 4:293--4), it may include \emph{reproach}, \emph{insult}, \emph{revile}, and even \emph{blaspheme}. However, \emph{defamation} takes over where \emph{mockery} ends and denotes ``The idea that abuse which injures the reputation is a preliminary form of murder,'' thereby it is a form of persecution that the reviler practices, and which believers are said not to hang around this type of persons. \emph{Defamatory} defines as ``damaging the reputation of a person or group by saying or writing bad things about them that are not true.''\cdfoot{defamatory}{2023-03-06} Simply the one who persecutes by defamatory means.
Found in 1~Cor 5:11, 6:10.
