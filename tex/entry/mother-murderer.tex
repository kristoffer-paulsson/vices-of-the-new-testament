Liddell describes ``\emph{striking one's mother}, \emph{a matricide}.'' \emph{Matricide} defines as ``a crime in which a person kills their mother.''\cdfoot{matricide}{2023-03-08} If anyone kills their mother, they have committed murder. If anyone kills their parent, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the thing, including proven sound before the congregational elders.
Found in 1~Tim 1:9.
