(\textit{katalalia}):
This word group, according to Kittel (TDNT 4:4), stands in contrast to \emph{sordid calumny} as \emph{unthinking gossip} as the big difference. Except that it is ``to importune someone with speeches,'' ``to prattle something to someone,'' and also ``to speak against, to accuse, someone,'' but is most likely common everyday slander. \emph{Slander} defines as ``statements that someone makes about another person that are not true and that harm their reputation, or the crime of making these statements.''\cdfoot{slander}{2023-03-06}
