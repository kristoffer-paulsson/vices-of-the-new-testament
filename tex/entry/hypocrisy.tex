(\textit{hypokrisis}):
According to Danker, the term denotes ``the idea of playing a role in a theatrical production extends by metonymy to the sphere of everyday life'' but also mentions \emph{pretense}. Thayer says \emph{dissimulation}, and Liddell says \emph{hypocrisy}, to which D. and T. agree. \emph{Hypocrisy} defines as ``pretending to be what you are not, or pretending to believe something that you do not.''\cdfoot{hypocrisy}{2023-03-27}
