(\textit{pleonexia}):
First, we need to pick up the core sentiment of \grc{πλέον ἔχειν} by reading \entref{unscrupulous competition}. Then  Delling connotes ``\emph{pleonexia} `the will to press one's advantage' \ldots The use of \emph{pleonexia} is more restricted. Formally it is `excess,' \ldots but the meaning is usually adverse: `greed,' \ldots `insatiability' in respect of food and pleasures, \ldots `immoderation' with \ldots `desire,' erotically \ldots finally the act of `encroaching on what belongs to others,' \ldots then esp. the desire for power etc., and esp. the `urge to assert oneself'.''\bkfoot{\grc{πλεονεξία}}{6:266--7}{\tdntDelling{}}
Finally, we conclude \emph{unscrupulous encroaching} by defining \emph{encroaching} as ``to take control or possession of something in a gradual way and often without being noticed.''\cdfoot{encroaching}{2023-03-24}
