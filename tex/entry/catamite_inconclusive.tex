(\textit{malakos}):
Is a hard word to cover, it mostly blends with soft, weak, and effeminate according to Liddell, Thayer on the other hand mentions the Lat. \emph{mollis} which according to Lewis \& Short can denote ``\emph{easily movable}, \emph{pliant}, \emph{flexible}, \emph{supple}; \emph{soft}, \emph{tender}, \emph{delicate}, \emph{gentle}, \emph{mild}, \emph{pleasant} \ldots [further in II.A] \ldots \emph{Tender}, \emph{delicate}, \emph{susceptible} \ldots \emph{in tender youth}, \ldots \emph{easily blushing}, \ldots In a bad sense, \emph{soft}, \emph{effeminate}, \emph{unmanly}, \emph{weak},'' also Danker mentions ``\emph{submissive}, as noun of one who is passive in a same-sex relationship.'' Conclusively it indicates some type \emph{effeminate} manly person but not precise enough to conclude when or how to apply as an actual sin.
Found in 1~Cor 6:9.
