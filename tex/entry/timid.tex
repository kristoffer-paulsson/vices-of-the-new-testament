(\textit{deilos}):
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on \emph{timid}. Which is cowardice in relationship to believing for mighty miracles or dying in persecution. It is necessary to overcome human fearfulness in relation to the eschatological sufferings under the tribulation. As examples in Matt 8:26 and Mark 4:40. \emph{Timid} defines as ``shy and nervous; without much confidence; easily frightened.''\cdfoot{timid}{2023-03-13}
