(\textit{blasphēmia}):
The word group, according to Beyer (TDNT 1:621--25), means ``abusive speech,'' ``word of evil sound,'' ``The word means further the strongest form of `personal mockery and calumniation,''' but weaker than \entref{defamatory}. \emph{Mockery} defines as ``the act of mocking someone or something,''\cdfoot{mockery}{2023-03-06} and \emph{blaspheme} as ``to use offensive words or make statements that show no respect for God or religion.''\cdfoot{blaspheme}{2023-03-06} It's usually translated as \emph{blasphemy} when used against God but as \emph{mockery} when against humans.
Found in Matt 15:19; Mark 7:22; Eph 4:31; Col 3:8.
