(\textit{oinophlygia}):
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on \emph{drunkenness}, but T. and Danker also mentions \emph{bubble up}, \emph{overflow}, then T. says \emph{wine-bibbing}, and D. adds ```excessive indulgence in wine,' boozing.''
Then: examining the few cognates found in L. gives a deeper understanding of what the concept is, \grc{οἰνοφλυγ-έω} ``\emph{to be drunken} or \emph{drunk},'' \grc{οἰνό-φλυξ} ``\emph{given to drinking}, \emph{drunken}.''
when examining the given text Xenophon, Apology 19 \emph{sottishness} is used.
Contextually this mentions the hedonist's old lifestyle since before salvation, when being sottish was cool, which is way more than \entref{drunkenness}. \emph{Booze} defines as ``to drink alcohol,''\cdfoot{booze}{2023-03-23} \emph{sot} defines as ``someone who often drinks too much alcohol.''\cdfoot{sot}{2023-04-20}
