(\textit{bebēlos}):
According to Hauck (TDNT 1:604--5), it means ``the place which may be entered by anyone \ldots `accessible.' It corresponds exactly to the Lat. \emph{profanus}.'' Further, it denotes ``it is used of persons in the sense of `unsanctified' or `profane.''' Profane is the use of the world for a vessel that is supposed to be clean and used for holy purposes, therefore it's not allowed to use it for worldly purposes but for holy use in the world. Further from TDNT is ``as applied to persons, \emph{bebēlos} in Heb 12:16 (alongside \emph{pornos} [i. \entref{male-sex-buyer} ii. \entref{male-prostitute}]) \ldots denotes profane men who are far from God; their unholiness includes ethical deficiency in accordance with the NT approach.'' \emph{Worldly} defines as ``experienced in the ways of the world,'' and as ``relating to or consisting of physical things and ordinary life rather than spiritual things.''\cdfoot{worldly}{2023-03-08} When in worldly use, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.
Found in 1~Tim 1:9; Heb 12:16.
