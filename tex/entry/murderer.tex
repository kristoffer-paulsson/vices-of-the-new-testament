Liddell connotes ``\emph{slayer}, \ldots \emph{self-murderers,} \ldots is so much more justly accounted a \emph{murderer}, Antipho 4.3.3 \ldots of the sword on which Ajax had thrown himself, \ldots even of a woman, \ldots you, my \emph{destroyer}.'' Also, Thayer and Gingrich say \emph{murderer}. It is highly important to understand that this also benefits the self-murderers, they also count in. In most eschatology, murderers end up in the lake of burning fire and brimstone, but also those that may die in that state as of heavenly exclusion. Also see \entref{killing}.
Found in Rev 21:8, 22:15.
