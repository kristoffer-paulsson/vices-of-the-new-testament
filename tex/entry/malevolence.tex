(\textit{kakia}):
To understand \grc{κακία} we first much understand \grc{κακός}. 
According to Grundmann, \grc{κακός} denotes as ``The word \emph{kakos}, already considered in relation to \emph{agathos}, expresses the presence of the lack. It is not positive; it is an incapacity or weakness. Like `evil,' it has more than purely moral significance. The wealth expressed in the developing concepts \ldots Thus \emph{kakos} means a. `mean,' `unserviceable,' `incapable,' `poor of its kind,' \ldots Greater precision is attained by additions. \ldots It also means b. `morally bad,' `wicked.' \ldots It then means c. `weak.' \ldots A final meaning d. is `unhappy,' `bad,' `ruinous,' `evil.' \ldots This fixes the meaning of the noun \emph{to kakon}, \emph{ta kaka}, `evil,' `suffering,' `misfortune,' `ruin.'''\bkfoot{\grc{κακός}}{3:469}{\tdntGrundmann}
