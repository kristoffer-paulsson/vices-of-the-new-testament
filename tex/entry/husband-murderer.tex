(\textit{androphonos}):
Liddell describes ``[1.] man-slaying \ldots [2.] of women, murdering husbands.'' Manslayer is a crime of the worst sort. May the person doing this --~if a woman~-- repent, and may her children forgive her. If a wife kills her husband, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented from it, including proven sound before the congregational elders.
Found in 1~Tim 1:9.
