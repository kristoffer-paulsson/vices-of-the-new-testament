(\textit{phonos}):
According to Liddell, there is a long denotation, but Thayer, Gingrich, and Danker may together shortly denote \emph{murder}, \emph{homicide}, \emph{slaughter}, \emph{killing}, and \emph{execution}. Then L. shortly denotes ``murder, slaughter, \ldots exact vengeance for the killing \ldots killing or not-killing, \ldots the murder of \ldots slaughter of Greeks, \ldots in law, murder, homicide, death as a punishment, \ldots blood when shed, gore, \ldots of a sacrifice, \ldots rarely in Prose of blood, \ldots corpse, \ldots rascal that deserves death, gallowsbird, a Dorian phrase, \ldots of the agent or instrument of slaughter, \ldots to be a death to heroes, \ldots of poison.'' It seems that partaking in the death penalty as an executioner could count as the sin of killing. Also, may it be prohibited to carry out a lethal action as of non-death penalty. However, whether causing a killing by self-defense of home, wife, or children and assaulting a burglar in one's own home may be said to count as exceptions thereof. Matt 15:19 and Mark 7:21, which mentions an inner evil contemplation of killing in one's heart, also counts as sin.
Found in Matt 15:19; Mark 7:21; Rom 1:29; 1~Tim 1:9.
