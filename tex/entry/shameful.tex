(\textit{aischrotēs}):
According to Bultmann the underlying words means ``The verb \emph{aischynō}, fully interchangable with \emph{ep-} and esp. \emph{kataischynō}, is often found in act. in the sense of `to shame' or `to bring to shame', \ldots The mid. is relatively uncommon, and has the common Greek sense of `being ashamed'. \ldots From the root \emph{aisch-} we also find \emph{aischros} in the NT in the sense of `that which is disgraceful' in the judgement of men.''\bkfoot{\grc{αἰσχρότης}}{1:189--91}{\tdntBultmann{}} 
Further, Danker defines \grc{αἰσχρότης} as \emph{shameful conduct}. 
Found in Eph 5:4.
