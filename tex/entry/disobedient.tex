(\textit{apeithēs}):
Said term with its noun form \grc{ἀπείθεια} and verb form \grc{ἀπειθέω} in the New Testament is correct to say only contrary to the obedience of God, Christ, the Gospel and the stated will of God. According to Bultmann (TDNT 6:10), ``in the sense `disobedient' is found in Gk. from the time of Thucyd. (earlier still in the sense `unworthy of belief').'' \emph{Disobedient} defines as ``refusing to do what someone in authority tells you to do.''\cdfoot{disobedient}{2023-03-11}
