(\textit{eris}):
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich connote \emph{strife}, \emph{quarrel}, and \emph{contention}, \emph{wrangling}. It is  distinct from \grc{διχοστασία} (\emph{dichostasia}) \emph{disunity}. It is rather about rivalry. \emph{Strife} defines as ``violent or angry disagreement,''\cdfoot{strife}{2023-03-17} \emph{quarrel} as ``to have an angry disagreement with someone,''\cdfoot{quarrel}{2023-03-17} and \emph{contention} as ``to have an angry disagreement with someone.''\emph{contention}{2023-03-19} L. also mentions \emph{rivalry} described as ``a serious and often continuing competition.'' It is about an open conflict regarding the upper hand or rivalry, doctrinal or usual but not \emph{disunity} as in settling with a side.
Found in Gal 5:20; Rom 1:29; 2~Cor 12:20.
