(\textit{phthonos}):
Both Thayer and Gingrich allow the use of \emph{envy}, but Liddell reaches deeper and denotes ``ill-will or malice, esp. envy or jealousy of the good fortune of others \ldots through envy, \ldots better to be envied than pitied! \ldots envy for, jealousy of, \ldots will grudge, deny, \ldots envy or jealousy felt by another, \ldots envyings, jealousies, heartburnings, \ldots a cause for indignation, a reproach.'' The total understanding seems to be the envyings of mostly material goods and opportunities. Also, the denoted type of envy leads to malice. Therefore, it is substantial to use \emph{covetousness} which defines as ``a strong wish to have something, especially something that belongs to someone else.''\cdfoot{covetousness}{2023-03-27}
