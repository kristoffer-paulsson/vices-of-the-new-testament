Liddell mentions the use or making of potions as in modern day witchbrew. \grc{φάρμακον} ``a drug, medicine, \ldots medicine for it, remedy against it, \ldots for a head-ache, \ldots in bad sense, an enchanted potion, philtre, so a charm, spell, enchantment, \ldots also a drug, poison, \ldots a remedy, cure, \ldots of a bridle, \ldots a remedy against.'' Mostly this is about the remedies in witchcraft which can comprehend a variaty of purposes and means. But most of all is the occultism and demon-worship included that concerns the most. See also \entref{witchcraft}, \entref{demon worship}, and \entref{abortifacient}.
