(\textit{apistos}):
The word does exist in Greek both in the secular and Christian sense. According to Bultmann (TDNT 6:175), the original \grc{πιστος} in the secular sense denotes ``\emph{Pistos}. In lit. this first means  a. `trusting' \ldots Inasmuch as trust may be a duty, \emph{pistos} can come to have the nuance `obedient' b. \emph{pistos} in the sense `trustworthy' is a word first used in the sphere of sacral law \ldots The expression \ldots denotes the conclusion of a treaty. \emph{ta pista} is the reliability of those bound by the treaty \ldots `fidelity' \ldots Similarly \emph{pistos} (`trustworthy', `faithful') is used of those who stands in a contractual relation.'' However, contrary as in the said sense B. (TDNT 6:204-5) describes ``\emph{apistos} \ldots `faithless' \ldots `without trust or confidence' \ldots `unworthy of credence' \ldots \emph{apisteo} \ldots `to refuse to believe', \ldots \emph{apistia} `unfaithfulness' \ldots `unbelief'.'' \emph{Faithless} defines as ``not loyal and not able to be trusted,''\cdfoot{faithless}{2023-03-11} and \emph{unfaithful} as ``not loyal or able to be trusted,''\cdfoot{unfaithful}{2023-03-11} finally \emph{unbelief} as ``the fact of not having religious belief.''\cdfoot{unbelief}{2023-03-11}
