(\textit{dichostasia}):
In order to understand the term, we need to understand its root. According to Schlier (TDNT 1:513), \grc{ἀφίστημι} denotes as ``In Heb 3:12 it is used expressly of religious decline from God. \ldots This apostasy entails an unbelief which abandons hope. According to 1 Tim 4:1 apostasy implies capitulation to the false beliefs of heretics. This apostasy is a eschatological phenomenon.'' That said is the beginning of the process of apostasy. The current term, on the other hand, is denoted by S. as ```Division', `disunity', `contention' \ldots In the NT it signifies `objective disunity' in the community. \emph{dichostasia} has a limited `political' sense. It is within the \emph{ekklesia} that \emph{dichostasia} arises.'' It's understood to be those people that weigh between two or more doctrinal heresies of misinformation that are misleading to the flock. \emph{Disagreement} is described with ``a situation in which people have different opinions, or an inability to agree,''\cdfoot{disagreement}{2023-03-14} and \emph{contention} using ``disagreement resulting from opposing arguments,''\cdfoot{contention}{2023-03-14} while \emph{disunity} with ``a situation in which people disagree so much that they can no longer work together effectively.''\cdfoot{disunity}{2023-03-14}
