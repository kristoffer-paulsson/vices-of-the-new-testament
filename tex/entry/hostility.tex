(\textit{echthra}):
According to Foerster, the term denotes ```Hatred,' `hostility,' as an inner disposition, as objective opposition and as actual conflict between nations, groups and individuals. \ldots In the NT \emph{echthra} (in the plur. instances of \emph{echthra}) as enmity between men is one of the works of the flesh along with \emph{eris} [\entref{quarrel}], \emph{zēlos} [\entref{fanaticism}], \emph{thymos} [\entref{outburst}]. \ldots The Law means enmity for man, i.e., enmity between men and enmity against God (not God's enmity against us as in Gal 3:10, but ours against God as in Rom 8:7).''\bkfoot{\grc{ἔχθρα}}{2:815}{\tdntFoerster{}}
