It seems that the difference to \entref{irreverent} is rather the skipping or negligence of basic NT biblical obligations to one's relatives and family prescribed by Jesus as expected in Christian conduct. \emph{piety} defines as ``a strong belief in God or a religion, shown by your worship and behavior.''\cdfoot{piety}{2023-03-08} When failing to do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.
Found in 1~Tim 1:9; 2~Tim 3:2.
