(\textit{oinophlygia}):
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on \emph{drunkenness}, but T. and Danker. also mentions \emph{bubble up}, \emph{overflow}, then T. says \emph{wine-bibbing}, and D. adds ```excessive indulgence in wine,' boozing.'' Contextually this mentions the hedonist's old lifestyle since before salvation, thereby a plentiful amount of boozing, which should be heavier than \entref{drunkenness}. \emph{Booze} defines as ``to drink alcohol.''\cdfoot{booze}{2023-03-23}
