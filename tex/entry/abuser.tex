(\textit{plēktēs}):
Thayer denotes ``([from] \emph{plēssō}) \ldots, (A. V. \emph{striker}), \emph{bruiser}, \emph{ready with a blow}; \emph{a pugnacious}, \emph{contentious}, \emph{quarrelsome person}.'' 
Then Gingrich denotes distinctly ``\emph{pugnacious man}, \emph{bully}.'' 
Danker connotes to G. ``[from][\emph{plēssō}; `smiter'] `one who is set on getting into a fight', bully.'' 
Liddell defines \grc{πλήκ-της} as ``\emph{striker}, \emph{brawler}, \ldots \emph{violent}, \emph{fierce} \ldots of wine.'' 
Then: examining the cognates found in L. gives a broader understanding of what the concept of \grc{πλη-} is,
\grc{πλήσσω} ``of persons \emph{struck with terror} or \emph{amazement} \ldots \emph{strike}, \emph{smite}, freq. in Hom., esp. of a direct blow, \ldots \emph{strike} one on \ldots \emph{having driven} him \emph{with blows}, \ldots \emph{struck} him, \ldots \emph{whip} on the horses to the fray, \ldots \emph{strike} with lightning, \ldots \emph{having smitten his} thighs, \ldots to be \emph{struck}, \emph{smitten}, \ldots \emph{stricken} by a man, \ldots of musical sounds, \ldots \emph{receive a blow}, \emph{to be heavily defeated}, \ldots \emph{to be smitten} emotionally,''
\grc{πληκ-τέον} ``\emph{one must strike},'' 
\grc{πλῆκ-τρον} ``\emph{anything to strike with} \ldots \emph{instrument for striking the lyre}, \emph{plectrum}, \ldots \emph{spear-point}, \ldots of lightning, \ldots a bee's \emph{sting}, \ldots \emph{cock's spur}, \ldots \emph{spur} of crayfish, \ldots \emph{goad}.''
The final sense here is punching or beating someone and mentally abusing or emotionally annoying somebody. Thereby looking at the possible person doing so, which supposedly can be called a \emph{brawler}, \emph{bully}, \emph{bruiser}, or understood best as an \emph{abuser}. \emph{Bullying} defines as ``the behavior of a person who hurts or frightens someone smaller or less powerful, often forcing that person to do something they do not want to do,''\cdfoot{bullying}{2023-03-24} and \emph{abusive} defines as ``using physical violence or emotional cruelty.''\cdfoot{abusive}{2023-03-24}
