\grc{κοίταις}
\index[grc]{κοιταις@\grc{κοίταις}} 
(\textit{koitais}, plural):
\grc{κοίτη} in singular according to Liddell means among others: \emph{bedstead}, \emph{marriage-bed}, \emph{of one dead}, \emph{lair} of a wild beast, a \emph{nest} of a bird, of the spider, of the fish, \emph{pen}, \emph{fold} for cattle, \emph{act of going to bed}, \emph{of sexual connection}. A very related word of Liddell is \grc{κοῖτος} which means: \emph{resting-place}, \emph{bed of birds}, \emph{stall}, \emph{fold}, \emph{pen}. 
\grc{κοίτη} itself should not be mistaken for sinful conduct but is used regarding many righteous men and women in the bible, even if not married. It is conclusive that \grc{κοῖτος} originally was about the nightly protection in the era of the stone-age. Animals and people pursued a nightly place to live and defend. Some animals live in pairs and build a common \grc{κοίτη}. The same thing with humans a man and woman cooperate for nightly protection, and around that place, builds or furnish what they call home. 
Technically it's a shared bed around which the whole household builds up. Think of it from the point of view of a birdnest, two birds builds a nest in which they mate, lay eggs, raises chicks, and sleep in it, everything contrary to other animals that do not have a monogamous relationship with their peers. 
In 2~Sam 11:13, Uriah goes back to his \emph{nest} to sleep for the second time -- the LXX uses the word \grc{κοίτη} here. 
In Gen 49:4, Reuben did climb his father Israel's \emph{nest} by sleeping with his wife. 
 Rom 9:10 says ``not only but except even Rebecca out of one \emph{nest} conceived, with our father Isaac (NA28; my translation).'' Technically \grc{κοίτη} as \emph{nest} is in itself normal human conduct. However, with many cohabitations -- wedded or not -- it's sinful polygamy. \emph{Nest} defines as ``to build a nest, or live in a nest,'' and ``a structure or other place where creatures, esp. birds, give birth or leave their eggs to develop.''\cdfoot{nest}{2023-03-10} Also, \emph{polygamy} defines as ``the custom or condition of being married to more than one person at the same time.''\cdfoot{polygami}{2023-03-10}
Found in Rom 13:13.
