According to Liddell and Gingrich, both say \emph{kidnapper} and \emph{slave-dealer}, Thayer goes further and explains ``(from \emph{andrapodizō}, and this from \emph{to andrapodon} -- from \emph{anēr} and \emph{pous} -- a slave, a man taken in war and sold into slavery), a \emph{slave-dealer}, \emph{kidnapper}, \emph{man-stealer}, i. e. as well one who unjustly reduces free men to slavery, as one who steals the slaves of others and sells them.'' 
\emph{Oppressor} defines as ``someone who treats people in an unfair and cruel way and prevents them from having opportunities and freedom.''\cdfoot{oppressor}{2023-03-10} 
Further, \emph{kidnapper} as ``someone who takes a person away illegally by force, usually in order to demand money in exchange for releasing them.''\cdfoot{kidnapper}{2023-03-10} 
Finally, \emph{trafficker} as ``a person who buys and sells goods or people illegally.''\cdfoot{trafficker}{2023-03-10} If anyone oppresses, kidnaps, or traffics somebody, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the oppression, including proven sound before the congregational elders.
