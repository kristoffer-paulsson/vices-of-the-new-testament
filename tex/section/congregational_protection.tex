\section{Congregational Protection}

For the congregation to remain intact spiritually so that it can withstand persecution in the physical, there are some sins that can never be tolerated among the holy saint, and which is!

Acts 15:20, 29, 21:25: \entgls{alisgēma ho eidōlon}, \entgls{eidōlothytos}, \entgls{haima}, \entgls{pniktos}, \entgls{porneia}.

In Rev 2, we find a list of the consequences for the churches. The concern is that in this chapter, all three are aforementioned: Jezebel (v20), Baalam (v14; 2~Pet 2:15; Jude 11), and the Nicolaitans (v6). According to Church history, Nicholas the deacon (Acts 6:5) later became apostate and started buying prostitutes and eating idol meat. The spirit of Jezebel in a false prophet seduces people to be spiritual adulterers and to conduct idolatry and similar. This conduct is the same strategy that Baalam (Cf Num 22) instructed Balak to conduct to overcome the children of Israel.
