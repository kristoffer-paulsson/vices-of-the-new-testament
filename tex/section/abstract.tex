\section*{Abstract}

This report is a study for a deeper understanding of the vices in the New Testament. The New Testament contains a number of lists enumerating vices as single phrases. Those phrases were isolated and studied permanently, where research has been conducted in antique Greek works, including renowned theological dictionaries. The goal was to find the true practical meaning because much of the apprehension of the true meaning has been lost or shifted over the years since the Reformation. Finally, 126 words and phrases were found, and after comprehensive studies, about 159 entries were authored in the English language.
