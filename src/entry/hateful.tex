Liddell agrees with Thayer and Gingrich on \emph{hateful} but also adds \emph{abominated}. \emph{Hate} defines as ``filled with or causing strong dislike,''\cdfoot{hate}{2023-03-11} and \emph{abominate} as ``to hate something very much.''\cdfoot{abominate}{2023-03-24} As a disposition to the second command in the Law of Christ, we are not supposed to hate others: the Bible tells us that the world may hate us because Jesus lives in our hearts, but also to hate what is wicked, the deeds, not the sinner.
Found in Titus 3:3.
