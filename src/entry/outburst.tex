According to Büchsel, said term denotes ``From the sense of `to well up,' `to boil up,' there seems to have developed that of `to smoke,' and then `to cause to go up in smoke,' `to sacrifice.' The basic meaning of \emph{thymos} is thus similar to that of \emph{pneuma}, namely, `that which is moved and which moves,' `vital force.' \ldots \emph{thymos} then takes on the meaning sense of a. desire, impulse, inclination, b. spirit, c. anger, d. sensibility, e. disposition or mind, f. thought, consideration. \ldots [for the writers] For them \emph{thymos} means spirit, anger, rage, agitation.''\bkfoot{\grc{θυμός}}{3:167}{\tdntBuchsel{}}
