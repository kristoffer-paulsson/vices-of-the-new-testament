According to Gutbrod, the meaning is ``having no law.''\bkfoot{\grc{ἄνομος}}{4:1086}{\tdntGutbrod{}} In 1~Cor 9:21, Paul instructs: ``I become lawless unto the lawless -- I am not without God's law but Christ's legal -- to gain those without any law (NA28; my translation).'' Technically even if Paul gained those without law by adapting to them, he never overlooked the Law of Christ. The big problem arises when someone disregards the worldly and the divine law simultaneously and thus becomes truly lawless.
Found in 1~Tim 1:9.
