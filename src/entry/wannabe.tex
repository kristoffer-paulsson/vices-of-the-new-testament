According to Delling, it denotes the following thing, ``The \emph{alazōn} is the one who `makes more of himself,' than the reality justifies, `ascribing to himself either more and better things than he has, or even what he does not possess at all,'; who `promises what he can not perform.' \ldots Very often the orator, philosopher, poet, magician, doctor, cook, or officer is called \emph{alazōn}, and especially the last of these.''\bkfoot{\grc{ἀλαζών}}{1:226--7}{\tdntDelling{}}
