## Vices

The vices described in the entries in the following list are compiled from: Gal. 5:19--21; Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:21; Rom. 1:29--31, 13:13; 1 Tim. 1:9--10, 2:8--10, 3:3--11, 3:13; Eph. 4:31, 5:3--5; 2 Tim. 3:2--4; 1 Cor. 5:10--11, 6:9--10; 2 Cor. 12:20--21; Tit. 1:7, 2:3, 3:3, 3:9; Col. 3:5, 3:8--9; Heb. 12:15, 12:16, 13:4; 1 Pet. 2:1, 4:3; Acts 15:20, 15:29, 21:25; Rev. 9:20--21, 21:8, 21:27, 22:15.

**Abominable**,
βδελύσσω (_bdelyssō_):
Rev 21:8.
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on _abominable_. In the NT this term is only regarding idolatry. CD defines _abominable_ as "very bad or unpleasant."

**Abomination**,
βδέλυγμα (_bdelygma_):
Rev. 21:27.
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on _abomination_. In the NT this term is only about the Antichrist as the "abomination of desolation," and about all the evil deeds of "the great whore of Babylon." Regarding those performing those deeds in an end-times context. CD defines _abomination_ as "something that you dislike and disapprove of."

 **Abortifacient**,
see _witchcraft_, another meaning of _pharmakeia_.
According to Britannica (s.v. abortifacient) "abortifacient, any drug or chemical preparation that induces abortion. … For centuries, herbal abortifacients have been made from infusions or oils of plants such as [purposefully censored]. Such preparations are no more likely to terminate a pregnancy than they are to induce potentially lethal reactions such as vomiting, hemorrhages, and convulsions in the women who take them. Truly effective abortifacients were not developed until the end of the 20th century, when the biochemical processes behind cell division and growth and the role of hormones in reproductive processes were understood." Technically the use of abortion pills counts in.

**Absurd speech**,
μωρολογία (_mōrologia_):
Eph. 5:4.
According to Bertram (TDNT 4:832), first μωρός denotes "_moros_ is related to the Sanskr. _muras_ ('dull-witted') and the Indo-European root mo[u]ro-. muro-. We also find the Attic _moros_. The Lat. _morus_, 'foolish,' 'absurd,' derives from the Gk. … _moros_ and cognates denote a physical or intellectual deficiency in animals or men, in their conduct and actions, also in things. The word can refer to physical sloth or dullness, but its main ref. is to the intellectual life," later μωρολογία denotes "[844 4.C] Among the warnings in Eph. 5 there is found in v. 4 that against _morologia_. The word occurs alongside _eutrapelia_ [sex-slander], which means adroitness of speech both in the good sense and the bad. The reference is thus to sins of the tongue, … Hence one is to think in terms of offensive, equivocal and foolish speech. But the terms are taken up yet again in the … of v. 6, and this seems to carry a warning against heresy. … Jesus and early Christian exhortation are opposed to the empty verbal debates which are found in Jewish schools and also in Gnosticising Christianity … These are described as fools, …They are … foolish questions, like the problem whether Lot's wife as a pillar of salt, or one who has risen from the dead, will make unclean according to the uncleanliness through contact with the dead." It is serious talk about serious things but on the level of an imbecile, whether what religiously applies when the power and grace of God can resurrect the dead into life. CD describes _imbecile_ as the level of intelligence corresponding to "a person who behaves in an extremely stupid way." Also _absurd_ as "ridiculous or completely unreasonable."

**Abuser**,
πλήκτης (_plēktēs_):
1 Tim. 3:3; Tit. 1:7.
Thayer denotes "(πλήσσω) …,  (A. V. striker), bruiser, ready with a blow; a pugnacious, contentious, quarrelsome person." Then Gingrich denotes distinctly "pugnacious man, bully." Danker connotes to G. "[πλήσσω; ‘smiter’]  ‘one who is set on getting into a fight’, bully." Then when checking an array of cognates against Liddell, the following is denoted: πλήσσω _sting_, _strike_, _stamp_ as one does a coin, _receive a blow_, _to be smitten_ emotionally, πληκ-τέον _one must strike_, πλῆκ-τρον _instrument for striking the lyre_, _plectrum_, _spear-point_, of  lightning, a bee's _sting_, finally πλήκ-της _striker_, _brawler_, _violent_, _fierce_. The total sense here is, punching or beating someone, as in physical and potentially emotional abuse. Thereby looking at the possible person doing so, which supposedly can be called a _brawler_, _bully_, _bruiser_, or understood best as an _abuser_. CD defines _bullying_ as "the behavior of a person who hurts or frightens someone smaller or less powerful, often forcing that person to do something they do not want to do," and _abusive_ as "using physical violence or emotional cruelty."

**Adulterer**,
μοιχός (_moichos_):
1 Cor. 6:9; Heb. 13:4.
In the Bible, according to BGM, both said occasions are in _masculine plural_, which means it is only male adulterers that God judges and excludes from heaven.

**Adultery**,
μοιχεία (_moicheia_):
Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:22.
In traditional catholic and protestant state religion, adultery happens when two persons, a man and a woman, where at least one is married, have intercourse with the one that is not the marital partner. It is not so in either NT or OT. In the OT, a man can divorce his wife if she behaves unseemly (Deu. 24:1) or stone her at said intercourse (Lev. 20:10) with another man. Thus the NT is sharpened compared to the OT (Mat. 5:32), he can only correctly divorce her if she commits _prostitution_, and he can verify it. In the NT, a man commits adultery when (Mat. 5:28) scouting for a _gynaika_ to have _cravings_ for her. Equally, a woman moving in with (Rom. 7:3) another man without being properly divorced or separated is called an adulteress. Then if someone divorces, it’s not a sin by itself. Remarriage is adultery under the wrong circumstances, one-sided for the marital dumper and for the man who marries the woman being a marital dumper. When laying out all verses (Mat. 5:32, 19:9; Mar. 10:11--12; Luk. 15:18) alongside and summing up the doctrine, occasionally there will be different results even when using well-translated Bibles such as KJV, YLT, ASV, NASB, and similar.  Even when not mixing multiple versions in parallel.

**Arrogant**,
αὐθάδης (_authadēs_):
Tit. 1:7.
According to Bauernfeind (TDNT 1:508--9), it denotes "The critical judgement … of the egocentric attitude, which as such necessarily leads to arrogance," denotes further "In the two passages in which _authades_ occurs in the NT the reference is to human impulse violating obedience to the divine command. In both cases it is religious leaders who are exposed to this danger or succumb to it." CD defines _arrogance_ as "the quality of being unpleasantly proud and behaving as if you are more important than, or know more than, other people." 

**Avaricious**,
see _money-phile_, another meaning of _philargyros_.

**Beguile**,
ψεύδομαι (_pseudomai_):
Col. 3:9.
The term is a sin that contextually applies to brethren in the Body of Christ, not concerning the world. "to lie, speak false, play false, … to say that which is untrue, … which I do not speak falsely about him, … to be false, perjured or forsworn, … to belie, falsify, … to break them, … had broken their word about the money, … to deceive by lies, cheat, … to deceive one in a thing." Then Thayer also denotes "'to deceive', 'cheat'; hence, properly, to show oneself deceitful, to play false … to lie, to speak deliberate falsehoods … to deceive one by a lie, to lie to … like verbs of saying." Then Danker and Gingrich shortly repeats about not living in falsehood to one another. CD defines _beguile_ as "to persuade, attract, or interest someone, sometimes in order to deceive them," see _falsehood_, _deceiving_, and _liar_.

**Betrayer**,
προδότης (_prodotēs_):
2 Tim. 3:4.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich mention _betrayer_ together with _traitor_. According to CD _betrayer_ is "a person who is not loyal to their country or to another person, often doing something harmful such as giving information to an enemy."

**Bitterness**,
πικρία (_pikria_):
Eph. 4:31; Heb. 12:15.
According to Michaelis (TDNT 6:122--5), the term denotes "originally 'pointed,' 'sharp,' e.g., of arrows …, then more generally of what is 'sharp' or 'penetrating' to the senses, a pervasive smell …, 'shrill' of a noise …, 'painful' to the feelings … esp. 'bitter,' 'sharp' to the taste … The final sense, so also in derivatives like _pikria_, 'bitterness,' the bitter taste of plants …, exerts the greatest influence; it is behind the transf. use in the sphere of the soul, where the experience of what is unpleasant, unexpected, or undesired is predominant. Thus the adj. is used with _lupe_ because it is painful, with laughter when this is tormented …, with tears …, not because they taste bitter, but because there is no desire to weep, because weeping bring no release." Later in NT context M. connotes "In Eph. 4:31 _pikria_ stands at the head of a short list of vices. It is followed immediately by _thumos_ [_outburst_] and _orge_ [_rage_]. Hence it does not mean the 'embitterment' which involves withdrawal and isolation (the word is not attested elsewhere in this sense) but 'bitterness,' 'resentment,' 'an incensed and angry attitude of mind' to once neighbor." Clearly this bitterness is not avoidant but outgoing towards those around oneself, therefore it could also be _sterness_ defined by CD as "the quality of being severe, or of showing disapproval."

**Blasphemy (conduct)**,
βλασφημία (_blasphēmia_):
Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:22; Eph 4:31; Col 3:8.
The word group, according to Beyer (TDNT 1:621--25), means "abusive speech," "word of evil sound," "The word means further the strongest form of 'personal mockery and calumniation,'" but weaker than _defamatory_. CD defines _mockery_ as "the act of mocking someone or something," and _blaspheme_ as "to use offensive words or make statements that show no respect for God or religion." It's usually translated as _blasphemy_ when used against God but as _mockery_ when against humans.

**Blasphemy (state)**,
βλάσφημος (_blasphēmos_):
1 Tim. 1:13; 2 Tim. 3:2.
The one conducting blasphemy or mockery. See also _blasphemy (conduct)_, _mockery_.

**Blood**,
αἷμα (_haima_):
Acts 15:20, 29, 21:25.
Behm (TDNT 1:172) says that the core physiological meaning is _blood_. Liddell also points to _streams of blood_, _bloodshed_, and _blood-relationship_. Gingrich adds _bloody deeds_, the blood of animals used for _cultic purposes_ or _purification_. All in contrast to the shed blood of Jesus Christ for our sins and salvific use. Thus Christians are to abstain and keep from bloody use except for slaughter in meat production by pouring it straight out the drain and nothing else. Because the life is in the blood and dedicated for the use at the altar, thus it is prohibited to eat it in Lev. 17:11-14. The CD defines _blood_ as “the red liquid that is sent around the body by the heart, and carries oxygen and important substances to organs and tissue, and removes waste products.”

**Boozing**,
οἰνοφλυγία (_oinophlygia_):
1 Pet. 4:3.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on _drunkenness_, but T. and Danker. also mentions _bubble up_, _overflow_, then T. says _wine-bibbing_, and D. adds "'excessive indulgence in wine,' boozing." Contextually this mentions the hedonist’s old lifestyle since before salvation, thereby a plentiful amount of boozing, which should be heavier than _drunkenness_. CD defines _booze_ as "to drink alcohol."

**Brutal (violence)**,
ἀσέλγεια (_aselgeia_):
Gal. 5:19; Mar. 7:22; 2 Cor. 12:21; 1 Pet. 4:3.
It should be said that general bible translations use words such as _lasciviousness_, and secondly _wantonness_. Another thing must be said, that it is used much differently in Hellenistic Greek. Danker opens up that it is unclear, "[etym. unclear (many conflicting theories), cp. ἀσελγής ‘licentious’] ‘wanton disregard for social/moral standards.’" Liddell proposes a different interpretation, ἀσέλγεια also means _wanton violence_,  _insolence_, and ἀσελγής also means _brutal_, _outrageous_, and ἀσελγαίνω also means _outrageous acts_. By analyzing the Greek text with its English counterpart, we will find out its real meaning. ἀσέλγεια translates in  Pl.R.424e "τοὺς νόμους καὶ πολιτείας σὺν πολλῇ, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἀσελγείᾳ, ἕως ἂν τελευτῶσα πάντα ἰδίᾳ καὶ δημοσίᾳ ἀνατρέψῃ." to " it proceeds against the laws and the constitution with _wanton licence_ [emphasis added], Socrates, till finally it overthrows all things public and private." and is used in a discussion about lawlessness in society. In  Is.3.13 as "οἳ μάχας καὶ κώμους καὶ ἀσέλγειαν πολλήν, ὁπότε ἡ τούτου ἀδελφὴ εἴη παρ᾽ αὐτῷ, μεμαρτυρήκασι γίγνεσθαι περὶ αὐτῆς." to "who have given evidence of quarrels, serenades, and frequent scenes of _disorder_ [emphasis added] which the defendant's sister occasioned whenever she was at Pyrrhus's house," used with wild partying. In D.4.9 as "ὁρᾶτε γάρ, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, τὸ πρᾶγμα, οἷ προελήλυθ᾽ ἀσελγείας ἅνθρωπος," to "For observe, Athenians, the height to which the fellow's _insolence_ has soared," used in a political speech. In Id.21.1 as "τὴν μὲν ἀσέλγειαν, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, καὶ τὴν ὕβριν, ᾗ πρὸς ἅπαντας ἀεὶ χρῆται Μειδίας" to "The _brutality and insolence_ [emphasis added] with which Meidias treats everyone alike are," used in a speech about brutalities and assaults in combination to parties. ἀσελγής translates in And.4.40 as "τοῦτον δὲ κολάσαντες τοὺς ἀσελγεστάτους νομιμωτέρους ποιήσετε." to "you will inspire a greater respect for the law in those whose _insolence_ [emphasis added] is uncontrolled," used in a speech about legal punishment. In D.2.19 as "δῆλον δ᾽ ὅτι ταῦτ᾽ ἐστὶν ἀληθῆ: καὶ γὰρ οὓς ἐνθένδε πάντες ἀπήλαυνον ὡς πολὺ τῶν θαυματοποιῶν ἀσελγεστέρους ὄντας" to "This report is obviously true, for the men who were unanimously expelled from Athens, as being of far _looser morals_ [emphasis added] than the average mountebank," used about looser morals leading to being expelled. In Id.21.128 as "σώφρονα καὶ μέτριον πρὸς τἄλλα παρεσχηκὼς αὑτὸν Μειδίας καὶ μηδένα τῶν ἄλλων πολιτῶν ἠδικηκὼς εἰς ἔμ᾽ ἀσελγὴς μόνον οὕτω καὶ βίαιος ἐγεγόνει" to "Meidias had in other respects behaved with decency and moderation, if he had never injured any other citizen, but had confined his _brutality and violence_ [emphasis added] to me." In Is.8.43 as "οὕτω τοίνυν ἀσελγὴς ὢν καὶ βίαιος καὶ τὴν τῶν ἀδελφῶν οὐσίαν ἀπεστερηκὼς οὐκ ἀγαπᾷ τὰ ἐκείνων ἔχων" to "This man, then, having shown himself so _brutal and violent_ [emphasis added] and having robbed his sisters of their fortune," used in the context of robbery. In Lys.24.15 as "λέγει δ᾽ ὡς ὑβριστής εἰμι καὶ βίαιος καὶ λίαν ἀσελγῶς διακείμενος," to "He says that I am insolent, savage, and _utterly abandoned_ [emphasis added] in my behavior." ὕβριστος is also used in context but denotes _outrageous_ and _insolence_, therefore its possible that said word specifically denotes _brutal violence_. It is the kind of violence that leads to legal punishment and being expelled. It is impossible that ἀσέλγεια has to do with soft sexual or sensual behavior, just because it may be related to drunkenness and carousal sometimes. CD denotes _savage_ as "extremely violent, wild, or frightening." Also, _violent_ as "using force to hurt or attack." Finally, _brutal_ as "cruel and violent."

**Calumniator**,
see _she-devil_, not specifically a woman but a reprobate or worldly person.

**Carouse**,
πότος (_potos_):
1 Pet. 4:3.
All Goppelt (TDNT 6:145), Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich mention _carouse_, _drinking-bout_, and _a drinking_. Formally, the focus is on getting drunk by alcohol, probably a wild party or festivity, and a wild night being drunk. CD defines _drinking game_ as "a game that involves players having to drink alcohol," and _carousing_ as "to enjoy yourself by drinking alcohol and speaking and laughing loudly in a group of people."

**Catamite (inconclusive)**,
μαλακός (_malakos_):
1 Cor. 6:9.
Is a hard word to cover, it mostly blends with soft, weak, and effeminate according to Liddell, Thayer on the other hand mentions the Lat. _mollis_ which according to Lewis & Short can denote "_easily movable_, _pliant_, _flexible_, _supple_;_ soft_, _tender_, _delicate_, _gentle_, _mild_, _pleasant_ … [further in II.A] … _Tender_, _delicate_, _susceptible_ … _in tender youth_, … _easily blushing_, … In a bad sense, _soft_, _effeminate_, _unmanly_, _weak_," also Danker mentions "_submissive_, as noun of one who is passive in a same-sex relationship." Conclusively it indicates some type _effeminate_ manly person but not enough meat on the bones to conclude when or how an actual sin.

**Choked**,
πνικτός (_pniktos_):
Acts 15:20, 29, 21:25.
In current verses, the _choked_ stands in direct context with _blood_. Both Bietenhard (TDNT 6:457), Thayer, and Gingrich agree with what G. denotes: "_strangled_, _choked to death_ of animals killed for food without having the blood drained from them" The connection between _blood_ and the _choked_ is that blood can be used for more than eating, like ceremonial purposes, therefore, the _choked_ clarifies the eating part of _blood_ even clearer.

**Clamor**,
κραυγή (_kraugē_):
Eph. 4:31.
In TDNT 3:898, Grundmann denotes "The meaning is a. 'to croak or cry with a loud and raucous voice' … (groan deeply) … (to be dissatisfied) … It is a war-cry … (of the capture of Jericho). … A second sense b. 'to demand with cries.'" Then Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich almost agree in _clamor_ or _outcry_. CD defines _outcry_ as "a strong expression of anger and disapproval about something, made by a group of people or by the public," and _clamor_ as "a loud complaint about something or a demand for something."

**Common**,
κοινός (_koinos_):
Rev. 21:27.
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich, including Grundmann (TDNT 3:789) agree in _common_. However, generally, a good term when used in the Kingdom of God but derogatory when in the world. In a sinful context only, to be communized in the world before judgment day, they should not enter into the gates of Heavenly Jerusalem.

**Covetousness**,
φθόνος (_phthonos_):
Gal. 5:21; Rom 1:29; Tit. 3:3; 1 Pet. 2:1.
Both Thayer and Gingrich allow the use of _envy_, but Liddell reaches deeper and denotes "ill-will or malice, esp. envy or jealousy of the good fortune of others … through envy, … better to be envied than pitied! … envy for, jealousy of, … will grudge, deny, … envy or jealousy felt by another, … envyings, jealousies, heartburnings, … a cause for indignation, a reproach." The total understanding seems to be the envyings of mostly material goods and opportunities. Also, the denoted type of envy leads to malice. Therefore, it is substantial to use _covetousness_ defined in CD as "a strong wish to have something, especially something that belongs to someone else."

**Craving**,
ἐπιθυμία (_epithymia_):
Tit. 3:3; 1 Pet. 4:3.
According to Büchsel (TDNT 3:168--171), said term denotes "the direct impulse towards food, sexual satisfaction etc., and also desire in general. In the first instance there is nothing morally objectionable or even suspicious about them. From the time of Plato, and esp. the Stoics, the term acquires a distinctive sense in Gk. philosophy. … In Plato _epithumia_ is still generally _vox media_. Reprehensible desire is called _epithumia kake_ [_evil cravings_, my translation]. To true philosophy, however, belongs theoretical and practical aloofness from the sensual world. … Epicurus divides _epithumia_ into _phusikai_, or natural, and _kenai_, illegitimate. The first may be divided again into purely natural and those that are necessary to happiness, tp freedom from bodily pain, and to life. … In Greek philosophy _epithumia_ is the waywardness of man in conflict with his rationality. It is estimated ethically rather than religiously. … In Hebrew Judaism religion there is condemnation not merely of the evil act but also of the evil will. The Decalogue forbids stealing and the desire for the goods of others, including their wives. … In the NT _epithumia_ and _epithumein_ are rare in the Gospels, more common in the Epistles. As in current speech, they are often _vox media_. Hence they may be used for the natural desire of hunger, … or longing, … or the desire of the **divine mysteries**, or for anything good. … Mostly, however, they indicate evil desire in accordance with the Greek and Jewish development considered under A. They may be characterized  as such by information as to the object: … a woman, … or the direction, … or the vehicle, … the world, … or the manner … can be used for sinful desire without any such addition. … For Paul, who alone in the NT offers an explicit doctrine of sinful man, _epithumia_ is a manifestation of the sin which  dwells in man and which controls him, but which is dead apart from the _epithumia_ stirred up by the Law, R. 7:7, 8. That desire is a result of the prohibition of sin reveals the carnality of man, Gl. 5:16, 24, his separation from God, his subjection to divine wrath, R. 1:18 ff. In James (1:14, 15)  _epithumia_ is regarded as the constant root in man of the individual acts of sin which the author's attention is mainly directed. The essential point in _epithumia_ is that it is desire as impulse, as motion of the will. It is, in fact, lust, since the thought of satisfaction gives pleasure and that of non-satisfaction pain. _epithumia_ is anxious self-seeking. Only exceptionally do we read of an _epithumein_ of love; _epithumein_ is normally used. In _epithumein_ man is seen as he really is, the more so because _epithumia_ bursts upon him with the force of immediacy. Even after the reception of the divine spirit [lower case], _epithumia_ is always a danger against which man must be warned and must fight." We need to understand that there are natural desires and cravings that are impulsive, they will only be overcome through sanctification which is the purpose of the Law to make us discover. Be aware of lusts overtaking your member and rather to the will of the Spirit. Lust is according to CD defined as "strong desire," and _craving_ defined as "a strong or uncontrollable desire".

**Deceiving**,
ψευδής (_pseudēs_):
Rev. 21:8.
According to Conzelmann (TDNT 9:595 A.1), the term denotes "c. the adj. _pseudes_ means trans. 'deceiving,' of persons, … dreams … oracles …, and in the pass. 'deceived,' … intr. 'untrue,' 'false,' 'fabricated.' … The adv. also means 'falsely,' … 'mistakenly.'" Totally in the mentioned context, it is an adj. thereby _deceiving_, which denotes an important rule, not to be deceiving to other people. CD defines _deceiving_ as "to persuade someone that something false is the truth; trick or fool."

**Defamatory**,
λοίδορος (_loidoros_):
1 Cor. 5:11, 6:10.
According to Hanse (TDNT 4:293--4), it may include _reproach_, _insult_, _revile_, and even _blaspheme_. However, _defamation_ takes over where _mockery_ ends and denotes "The idea that abuse which injures the reputation is a preliminary form of murder…," thereby it is a form of persecution that the reviler practices, and which believers are said not to hang around this type of persons. CD defines _defamatory_ as "damaging the reputation of a person or group by saying or writing bad things about them that are not true." Simply the one who persecutes by defamatory means.

**Demon worship**,
προσκυνέω ὁ δαιμόνιον (_proskyneō ho daimonion_):
Rev. 9:20.
According to Foerster (TDNT 2:1--20), "[A.2] It is first used a. to denote 'gods,' and may still be used in the sense in Hellenism. More specifically, it is used b. for 'lesser dieties.' This is Plato's allusion when he defines _daimones_ as _theoi_… Since _daimon_ is more general than _theos_, it is used c. when an 'unknown superhuman factor' is at work … Again, especially in the tragic dramatists, it denotes d. 'anything that overtakes man,' such as destiny, or death, or any good or evil fortune … It can also be use generally for 'fate,' … From this sense it is only a step to e. that of a 'protective deity' watching over a man's life, or certain portions of it. … By the time of the Orphics this has led to the coining of the words _eudaimon_ and _kakodaimon_ [_evil demon_, my translation] … In Stoicism  _daimon_  then became f. a term for the 'divinely related element in man." Further, "[A.3] In the more detailed development of the doctrine that demons are intermediary beings, regard is had to popular belief at three specific points. [#1] First, it is noteworthy that demons are brought into special connection with those parts of the cultus  and religion which are closest to animism, i.e., with magic incantations. … there emerges already a distinction between the higher forms of religion and the lower and more popular forms with which demons or evil demons are connected. In the developed form of this conception demons are forces which seek to divert from true worship. … [#2] Secondly, it is to be noted that the demons as rulers of human destiny are specifically connected with misfortune and distress. [#3] Thirdly, many philosophical systems have assimilated the doctrine of demons possessing men. Extraordinarily conditions are popularly ascribed to indwelling deities, especially in the tragic dramatists and e.g. Hippocrates. This was called _daimonan_ or _daimonizesthai_, a view which is developed … to the effect that evil demons clothe themselves with flesh and blood in the human body to kindle evil desires. But Plutarch already speaks plainly of demons which undermine virtue. … this view is then linked with astrology … and on the other hand it can be argued that falsehood belongs to the very essence of demons. … Philosophy incorporated these intermediaries  into its system and world view by ascribing _pathe_ to demons and by giving at least to evil demons a location close to the earth. … Their wickedness is not simply that of implacably and causelessly evil will; it is due to their link with matter, and may thus be regarded as an impulsion by cravings which are not familiar to man, whether in the form of envy, or a self-seeking desire for honor, or the thirst for blood and the odor of sacrifice." Finally, in the NT "[C.2] Basically the NT stands in the OT succession. There is no reference to spirits of the dead; the dead sleep until the resurrection. _Daimon_, with its suggestion of an intermediary between God and man, is avoided. Angels and demons are antithetical. Indeed, it is only in the NT that we have a full and radical distinction. … When we survey the passages mentioned, we note first how comparatively infrequent are the NT references to demons except in the case of the possessed. No trace whatever remains of the belief in ghosts, which is so important in the Rabbis. … Nevertheless, the fact that demons are mentioned only with relative infrequency in the NT does not mean that their existence and operation are contested or doubted. For Paul witchcraft is meddling with demons. But there can also be intercourse with demons in the normal heathen cultus (1 Cor. 10:20 f.)." CD defines _worship_ as "to have or show a strong feeling of respect and admiration for God or a god," also "to go to a religious ceremony." Finally, _demon_ as "an evil spirit."

**Disinforming**,
δίλογος (_dilogos_):
1 Tim. 3:8.
According to Liddell _double-tongued_, _doubtful_, in Thayer _double-tongued_, _double in speech_, "saying one thing with one person, another with another (with intent to deceive)," Gingrich also _double-tongued_, _insincere_. In the context of a congregational deacon. CD defines _disinformation_ as "false information spread in order to deceive people." And _misleading_ as "causing someone to believe something that is not true."

**Disobedient to parents**,
γονεύς ἀπειθής (_goneus apeithēs_):
Rom. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2.
See _disobedient_, specific context in relation to parents.

**Disobedient**,
ἀπειθής (_apeithēs_):
Tit. 3:3.
Said term with its noun form ἀπείθεια and verb form ἀπειθέω in the New Testament is correct to say only contrary to the obedience of God, Christ, the Gospel and the stated will of God. According to Bultmann TDNT (6:10), "in the sense 'disobedient' is found in Gk. from the time of Thucyd. (earlier still in the sense 'unworthy of belief')." CD defines _disobedient_ as "refusing to do what someone in authority tells you to do."

**Dissipated**,
ἀκρατής (_akratēs_):
2 Tim. 3:3.
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich are confluent in the following terms: _immoderate_, _without self-control_, _intemperate_, _dissolute_. CD defines _dissipated_ as "spending too much time enjoying physical pleasures and harmful activities such as drinking a lot of alcohol."

**Disunity**,
διχοστασία (_dichostasia_):
Gal. 5:20.
In order to understand the said term, we need to understand its root. According to Schlier (TDNT 1:513), denotes ἀφίστημι as "In Heb. 3:12 it is used expressly of religious decline from God. … This apostasy entails an unbelief which abandons hope. According to 1 Tim. 4:1 apostasy implies capitulation to the false beliefs of heretics. This apostasy is a eschatological phenomenon." That said is the beginning of the process of apostasy. The current term, on the other hand, is denoted by S. "'Division', 'disunity', 'contention' … In the NT it signifies 'objective disunity' in the community. _dichostasia_ has a limited 'political' sense. It is within the _ekklesia_ that _dichostasia_ arises." It's understood to be those people that weigh between two or more doctrinal heresies of misinformation that are misleading to the flock. CD describes _disagreement_ with "a situation in which people have different opinions, or an inability to agree," and _contention_ using "disagreement resulting from opposing arguments," while _disunity_ with "a situation in which people disagree so much that they can no longer work together effectively."

**Drugs**,
see _witchcraft_, another meaning of _pharmakeia_.

**Drunkenness (woman)**,
μέθυσος (_methysos_):
1 Cor. 5:11, 6:10.
see _drunkenness_, same but about women and wine, specifically the alcohol culture among women.

**Drunkenness**,
μέθη (_methē_):
Gal. 5:21.
According to Preisker (TDNT 4:545), μέθυσος denotes "'drunk' (with wine). In early lit. use is restricted to the feminine sex," then μέθη distinguishably denotes "'drink,' … mostly 'over-rich drinking,' … often 'intoxication,' 'drunkenness.'" CD describes _intoxication_ as "the condition of having lost some control of your actions or behavior under the influence of a drug." Also _drunkenness_  as "the state of being drunk (= under the influence of alcohol)."

**Egomaniacal**,
τυφόω (_typhoō_):
1 Tim. 3:6.
Thayer denotes "properly, _to raise a smoke_, _to wrap in a mist_; used only metaphorically:  1. _to make proud_, _puff up with pride_, _render insolent_; passive, _to be puffed up_ with haughtiness or pride." Then, Gingrich denotes: _be puffed up_, _be conceited_. Also, a range of cognates from Liddell goes: τύφω _raise a smoke_, _consume in smoke_, _burn slowly_, _smolder_; τυφόω _delude_, _to be crazy_, _demented_, _rendered vain_, _filled with insane arrogance_; τῦφος _vapor_, _conceit_, _vanity_; τυφογέρων _silly old man_, _dotard_; τυφομανία _delirium_, _mad delusion_; τυφοπλαστέω _invent a falsehood_, _deceiving_ himself; τυφοποιέω _construct an imaginary world_; τυφώδης a person in fever, _delirious_. A lot is mentioned about fever but being puffed up doesn't seem like normal pridefulness instead it seems to be a puffed-up delirious ego of vanity. CD defines _vanity_ as "used to describe something that is done with the aim of getting praise, fame, or approval rather than for serious or good reasons," and _egocentric_ as "thinking only about yourself and what is good for you," else _conceited_ as "too proud of yourself and your actions and abilities," and _egomaniacal_ as "relating to someone who considers themselves to be very important and able to do anything that they want."

**Egotist**,
φυσίωσις (_physiōsis_):
2 Cor. 12:20.
Liddell connotes with others "a being puffed up, inflation," then Thayer denotes "a puffing up of soul, loftiness, pride," and Gingrich mentions "being puffed up, pride, conceit." Then the entire understanding is an ego puffed up in the soul because of lofty pride thereto. CD describes _egotist_ as "a person who considers himself or herself to be better or more important than other people." Also, _conceit_ as "the habit or attitude of thinking yourself better than others, even when there is no reason to think so."

**Ensnaring**,
δόλος (_dolos_):
Mar. 7:22; Rom 1:29; 1 Pet. 2:1.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich connotes _guile_, _craft_, _cunning_, _deceit_, and _treachery_. Totally entrapment or ensnarement. CD describes _snare_ as "a trick or situation that deceives you or involves you in some problem that you do not know about," and finally _entrapment_ as "the act of causing someone to do something they would not usually do by tricking them." 

**Erotic perversion**,
πάθος (_pathos_):
Col. 3:5.
According to Michaelis (TDNT 5:926--28), the term denotes "[#1] 1. _pathos_. used from the tragic poets, … It first denotes an 'experience,' … Even without addition it is used _in malam partem_ for 'misfortune,' 'mishap,' 'defeat,' 'sickness,' etc. The meaning 'mood,' 'feeling,' 'emotion' etc. is very common in both good sense and a bad; … This meaning is often _in malam partem_: 'passion,' 'impulse.' … Under Pythagorean influence is the use of _pathos_ for 'changes,' 'modifications,' 'process,' … also 'attribute' … As a rhetorical tt. for emotional expression: 'pathos.' … [2#] 2. In the NT_pathos_ occurs only in Pl., plur. R.1:26, sing. Col. 3:5; 1 Th, 4:5. The _pathe atimias_ of R. 1:26a are the scandalous vices of homosexuality, 1:26b, 27. If _akatharsia_, elsewhere (including Col. 3:5) used for sexual impurity, is more general in 1:24 …, _pathos_ is the latest point for transition to the depiction of sexual perversion, and thus denotes erotic passion. When Col. 3:5 adds to the demand … the clarifying list: _porneian_ [_prostitution_], _akatharsian_ [_foul (conduct)_], _pathos_ [_erotic perversion_], _epithumian kaken_ [_maleficent craving_], appending also the clause _kai ten pleonexian_ [_unscrupulous encroaching_] _hetis estin eidololatria_ [_idolatry_] …, 4 closely related concepts are contrasted with the final _pleonexia_. Since _porneia_ and _akatharsia_ … already have a sexual reference, _pathos_ here cannot mean 'passion' or 'feeling' in general, but denotes 'erotic passion.' This use leads back to Jewish writings. …, one may detect a contribution made by the Hell. concept. But apart from Philo … we must refer esp. to Joseph. … and Test. Jos. 7:8 … esp. as _pathos_ and _epithumia ponera_ (= _kake_, Col. 3:5) occur together here, so that _pathos_ seems to be an erotic urge which is first given active expression as sin by _epithumia ponera_. This would give a well-planned climax in Col. 3:5 too. Since R. 1:26 and Col. 3:5 are not oriented to the Stoic _pathos_ concept, the same applies to 1 Th. 4:5, … _pathos epithumias_ does not mean _epithumia_ as _pathos_ in the Stoic sense but _pathos_ as sexual passion which is combined with or grows out of (gen. of origin, not quality as in R. 1:26) _epithumia_." M. denotes that _erotic passion_ has a lower boundary where _maleficent craving_ begins but not earlier. In modern sense _kink_ as defined by CD "a strange habit, usually of a sexual nature" may not be sinful until a certain limit kicks in. This limit extends from M:s article, which sees a connection between πάθος and ἐπιθυμία κακός. The conclusion is that sin happens first when kink becomes a) a _craving_, b) _malevolence_, or c) _maleficent craving_, of which the last also count as idolatry. _Kinky_ is also defined by CD as "unusual, strange, and possibly exciting, especially in ways involving unusual sexual acts," and _perversion_ as "sexual behavior that is considered strange and unpleasant by most people." Because of modernity and outdated semantic meanings, the term is renamed _erotic perversion_. Thereby being _kinky_ below _craving_, _malevolence_, and _maleficent craving_, are not to be counted as _erotic perversion_. 

**Evil**,
πονηρία (_ponēria_):
Mar. 7:22; Rom. 1:29.
First we need to understand πονηρός, according to Harder (TDNT 6:546), which denotes "The original verb is _penomai_ from which come _penia_ 'poverty' and _penes_, _penichros_ 'poor,' 'needy' … Related to _ponos_, it has throughout class. Gk. the original sense 1. 'laden with care,' 'sorrowful,' 'unhappy.' … 'laden with the exercise and care of rule.' … 2. Then _poneros_ denote 'that which causes trouble and brings sorrow.' …  'speech which brings disaster,' …  'trouble which brings evil,' … 3. _poneros_ thus take the sense of 'pitiable,' 'incompetent,' 'wretched,' 'poor.' It can also mean 'badly contrived,' 'in poor shape,' 'unattractive,' 'unfit,' 'unserviceable,' 'pernicious, … 'unfavorably disposed,' … 'politically useless,' the 'parasite on the commonwealth,' even the 'enemy of state.' … 'morally reprehensible' … 'willingly and knowingly bad.' … 'full of trouble,' 'unfortunate' … 'useless,' 'false,' 'wrong,' 'harmful,' 'unfavorable,' 'offensive,' thus 'deceptive.' … Naturally there is a general use of _poneros_ in the moral sense for 'morally reprehensible,' 'useless,' 'bad,' 'evil.' … When _ho poneros_  is used for the devil, it is based on NT usage." Then built upon this, the understanding of πονηρία connotes as (p. 563) "_poneria_ is the 'intentionally practiced evil will,' … in contrast to conduct … 'unceasing baseness' is _mochtheria_, moral uselessness … Similarly _poneria_ is to be distinguished from _agnoia_ and _abelteria_ 'stupidity.' _poneria_ affects others, _abelteria_ only the one who acts. The original social signification of the term … may be discerned here. Its essential future acc. to Demetrius … us that it is always out for gain - something which may still be seen in the NT use." Therefore πονηρία is nothing but utter evil. CD defines _evil_ as "something that is very bad and harmful."

**Exterminator**, 
διώκτης (_diōktēs_): 
1 Tim. 1:13.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on _persecutor_. CD defines _persecutor_ as “someone who treats a particular group of people cruelly.” Also, _exterminator_ as “a person whose job is to kill a particular type of animal that is not wanted in a place,” where the Christians are considered unwanted pestilence.

**Extortionary**,
ἅρπαξ (_harpax_):
1 Cor. 5:10, 11, 6:10.
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich generally agree on _rapacious_, _extortioner_, and _ravenous_, _swindler_, also _robber_. The most likely meaning is someone that practices snatching when needed or very greedily, in bible translations, _extortioner_ seems most common. CD defines _extortionary_ as "relating to extortion (= the act of getting something, especially money, by force or threats)."

**False assertion**,
ψευδομαρτυρία (_pseudomartyria_):
Mat. 15:19.
According to Strathmann (TDNT 4:513), the term denotes "'the false witness' … The construction is not to be explained in the same way as … etc., where _pseudo-_ implies that what the main word denotes is claimed only _pseudos_ [_falsehood_] or falsely.  On the contrary, the main word is taken verbally as in _pseudangelos_ (declaring lies, false messenger, Hom., Aristot.) … The word thus means one who attests something which is false. It is not contested that the person concerned is a witness, as though he had no direct knowledge of the persons, relations or events at issue. What is disputed is the correctness of what he says. … When in Plat. Gorg. (472b) in the discussion of the thesis of Socrates …, Polos brings against Socrates the whole host of the Athenians as witnesses, and Socrates calls these _pseudomartyras_ with whose help …, he is not saying that they cannot be regarded as witnesses, but simply that … because that they testify to what is false. Whether a man is _martys_ or _pseudomartys_ depends on whether or not he tells the truth. The biblical use is similar." We here talk about someone that is not necessarily the eye or earwitness but someone that could be a herald or messenger, whether spreading information or making statements or claims. It is necessary to certify whether it is absolutely true or if such an impression is delivered. It can easily lead to an accusation of falsely certifying that a said statement isn’t true. CD defines _assertion_ as "a statement that you strongly believe is true." See _falsehood_, _liar_.

**Falsehood**,
ψεῦδος (_pseudos_):
Rev. 21:27, 22:15.
According to Conzelmann (TDNT 9:595 A.1) the term denotes "b. The noun _pseudes_ means 'what is untrue,' 'deceit,' 'falsehood,' 'lying,' 'lie,' … whether in obj. or the subj. sense is open as in the case of the verb. This leads on to the use in logic on the one side and in the ethics on the other." The main focus is on deceiving and being untrue. CD defines _untrue_ as "not true; false," then _falsehood_ as "a lie or a statement that is not correct."

**Fanaticism**,
ζῆλος (_zēlos_):
Gal. 5:20; 2 Cor. 12:20.
According to Stumpff (TDNT 2:877--8), the current term denotes "is usually translated 'zeal,' … a. _zelos_ as the capacity or state of passionate committal to a person or cause is essentially _vox_media_ … Thus the word is found in Plato in a list with partly good and partly bad emotions .,. It is also found in the plur. in a biographical and anthropological sense as a comprehensive word to denote the forces which motivate a personality, … also the sense of 'taste' or 'interest,' … 'the warlike spirit (of a tribe),' … Occasionally it can mean 'style' in the literary sense, … b. _zelos_ as orientated to a worthy goal … can have the sense of  the 'zeal of imitation,' … and this may take on the heightened sense of 'passionate rivalry,' … or with only a slight shift of meaning, 'zealous recognition,' 'praise' or 'fame,' … or even 'enthusiasm,' … The word here serves  to denote a noble ethical impulse towards the development of character, and to this degree it is to be distinguished from envy or jealousy. … c. Zeal can also take a less reputable form … 'passion which poisons human society' … (miserable, pitiable) … (shrieking discordantly, spreading evil rumors)." CD describes _zealot_ as "a person who has very strong opinions about something, and tries to make other people have them too," and _fanaticism_ as "extreme beliefs that may lead to unreasonable or violent behavior."

**Father-murderer**,
πατρολῴας (_patrolōas_):
1 Tim. 1:9.
Liddell describes "one who slays his father, a patricide." CD defines _patricide_ as "the crime of killing your own father." If anyone kills their father, they have committed murder. If anyone kills their parent, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the thing, including proven sound before the congregational elders.

**Festival**,
see _revel_, the whole meaning of _kōmos_. Also, see _idol worship_ and _idolatry_.

**Foolishness**,
ἀφροσύνη (_aphrosynē_):
Mar. 7:22.
According to Bertram (TDNT 9:22-35), firstly ἀφρων means _without understanding_, _befooled_, _mad_, _out of one's mind_, _lack of understanding_, and secondly ἀφροσύνη means _to be irrational_, _youthful folly_. There are two main understandings, the religious and the worldly. In the religious understanding, a person who commits acts or sins in a way that may cut him off from God is foolish. On the other hand, worldly foolishness is very grave and which acts leads to lynching. CD defines _foolishness_ as "the quality of being unwise, stupid, or not showing good judgment." Also, _madness_ as "stupid or dangerous behavior."

**Foul (conduct)**,
ἀκαθαρσία, (_akatharsia_):
Gal. 5:19; Eph. 5:3; 2 Cor. 12:21; Col. 3:5.
In LXX the term is about the hazardous and contagious but in the Pentateuch only about bio-hazards, also in the TDNT, Hauck describes the New Testament version of filth in terms that denotes the purification through sanctification. (TDNT 3:428) "uses the words of moral impurity which excludes man from fellowship with God (opposite _hagios_). Paul adopts _akatharsia_ from Judaism as a general description of the absolute alienation from God in which heathenism finds itself. But for him the term no longer has ritual significance." Liddell denotes filth as _uncleanliness_, the _foulness_ of wound, _dirt_, _filth_, in a moral sense _depravity_. Danker agrees with _filth_, _dirt_, and _moral depravity_. It's clearly about filthy/foul conduct, especially in the sphere of economics and social affairs, and may extend somewhat into the sexual arena, even as demonically influenced but mostly as a willful choice of lifestyle. CD defines _foul_ as "extremely unpleasant," and "to pollute something or make it dirty," including "to commit a foul against another player."

**Foul (state)**,
ἀκάθαρτος, (_akathartos_):
Eph. 5:5.
LXX mentions foul spirit in context (Zec. 13:2) of cleansing the land of God together with the false prophets, foul spirits are mentioned 23 times in the NT, the spirits that make people foul if invited through a vile lifestyle. According to 2 Cor. 6:14--18, we should not touch the foul but be received by the Lord, all connected to idolatry and association with Belial. The foulness has the be cleansed, presumably by casting out foul spirits and ending the vile lifestyle. Also see _foul (conduct)_, _idolatry_.

**Fraudster**,
κλέπτης (_kleptēs_):
1 Cor. 6:10.
Preisker (TDNT 3:754--5), first explains κλέπτω, and denotes "a. 'To steal,' 'secretly and craftily to embezzle and appropriate,' … No blame is attached in these passages; indeed, cunning and skill displayed are recognized, hence gods, demigods and heroes steal (… deduces from Epicurean ethics that stealing is justifiable for this philosophy so long as is takes place … 'with craft and secrecy'). Later it's condemned as no less wrong than robbery, murder, and other serious offenses. _klepto_ denotes the secret and cunning act as compared with _arpazo_, which is characterized by violence (_bia_) … The objects may be articles of value, … animals, … or men (in the sense 'to abduct'), … The ref. might also be to places, … ('to seize with cunning, unnoticed') or to circumstances, … ('to provide for oneself surreptitiously'). b. More generally the word can mean 'to deceive,' 'to cheat,' 'to bewitch (by flattery),' … c. A further meaning is 'to hold secretly,' 'to put away,' 'to conceal,' 'to hide.' … d. 'To do something in secret or furtive manner.'" Then κλέπτης itself denotes as "is a. 'the theif,' … is also b. 'one who acts with subterfuge and secrecy,' … 'you are found as one who secretly stole the voices which otherwise would have been for him.'" Therefore it could be anything between _abducting_ defined by CD as "to take a person away by force," then _thievery_ described as "the crime of stealing things," also _trickery_ described as "the use of tricks intended to deceive, as a way of cheating someone," and _fraud_ described as "the crime of obtaining money or property by deceiving people."

**Fraud**,
κλέμμα (_klemma_):
Rev. 9:21.
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich generally agree on _theft_ and _fraud_. In the context of done in the past, in an end-times scenario. Also, see _fraudster_, _thief_, and _stealing_.

**Gay-partner**,
ἀρσενοκοίτης (_arsenokoitēs_):
1 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 6:9.
Thayer connotes "(ἄρσην a male; κοίτη a bed), one who lies with a male as with a female, a sodomite." Technically this is about man-gay sex, but it seems that it can interpret differently if the combining words are more deeply understood. See _nests (multiple)_ to connote the word κοίτη as singular, generally about cohabiting. Generally speaking, it is two men, a husband being sexually cohabited by a male, technically gay partnership. CD defines _civil partnership_ as "in the UK, a legal relationship between two people of the same sex that gives them the same rights as people who are married." Also, _partner_ as "the person you are married to or living with as if married to them, or the person you are having a sexual relationship with."

**God-hating (inconclusive)**,
θεοστυγής (_theostygēs_):
Rom. 1:30.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich are equally confused but distinct, either _godforsaken_ or _god-hating_. It is not clear whether God-forsaken, hating God, or both.

**Gossipmonger**,
ψιθυριστής (_psithyristēs_):
Rom. 1:29.
Liddell connotes "a whisperer: a slanderer," then Thayer says "a whisperer, secret slanderer, detractor," and Gingrich mention "whisperer, talebearer," then also Danker says "gossipmonger, tale-bearer." Simply, said, someone slandering behind people's backs without letting them know. The same thing as a slanderer except in secret conversation behind someone's knowledge. CD defines _gossipmonger_ as "someone who enjoys talking about other people and their private lives."

**Gossip**,
ψιθυρισμός (_psithyrismos_):
2 Cor. 12:20.
Liddell connotes "a whispering, … whispering, slandering," then Thayer says "(… to whisper, speak into one's ear), a whispering, i. e. secret slandering," then Gingrich mentions "whispering, gossip, talebearing," finally, Danker denotes "‘information conveyed in a hushed tone’, w. connotation of being denigrating covert gossip, tale-bearing." Denoting what D. says, the term is about slandering in secrecy and spreading rumors or illicit information, thereby the gravest slander of all, the one that is most important to set a stop to before people may wish to leave earth. CD defines _gossip_ as "conversation or reports about other people's private lives that might be unkind, disapproving, or not true."

**Greed**,
see _money-phile_, another meaning of _philargyros_.

**Hateful**,
στυγητός (_stygētos_):
Tit. 3:3.
Liddell agrees with Thayer and Gingrich on _hateful_ but also adds _abominated_. CD defines _hate_ as "filled with or causing strong dislike," and _abominate_ as "to hate something very much." As a disposition to the second command in the Law of Christ, we are not supposed to hate others: the Bible tells us that the world may hate us for Jesus living in our hearts, but also hate what is wicked, the deeds, not the sinner.

**Haughty disdain (conduct)**,
ὑπερηφανία (_hyperēphania_):
Mar. 7:22.
See _haughty disdain (state)_

**Haughty disdain (state)**,
ὑπερήφανος (_hyperēphanos_):
Rom. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2.
According to Bertram (TDNT 8:525--8) the term denotes "[A] The meaning 'outstanding,' 'distinguished' … But both adj. and the derived noun _hyperephania_ are used in the main censoriously of pride, arrogance, boasting. _hyperephanos_ is between _hybristes_ [_hubris_] and _alazon_ [_wannabe_], … Unlike _hybristes_, who acts violently in spite of divine and human law … and the _alazon_ …, the empty boaster who deceives himself and others by making the most of his advantages, abilities and achievements, the _hyperephanos_ is the one who with pride, arrogance, and foolish presumption brags of his position, power  and wealth and despises others. Both adj. and noun are used of men and supermen …, their acts …, or their attitude to others … the _hyperephanos polites_, who is puffed up and annoying, is contrasted with the honorable and respected citizen. … luxuary, ease and opulence are the soil in which _hyperephania_ develops as well as _hybris_ … the ref. is to private houses which are not only more ornate (_hyperephanos_) than those of the most but are even more lavishly  (_semnos_) furnished than public buildings. In line with such traditions Hell. ethics is usually against _hyperephania_. … [D] In the NT the noun _hyperephania_ occurs only once and the adj. _hyperephanos_ five times. The usage is shaped by the OT  and the Hellenistic Jewish  tradition with its list of vices. … The group of divinely hated despisers of men, the arrogant and the boastful (or arrogant boasters) is interrelated. According to the exposition of the early Church the arrogant are those who brag of what they have to the have-nots. In the list of vices in 2 Tm. 3:2 _alazones_ comes before _hyperephanoi_. For the author the two terms denote different form of arrogance. The moral chaos depicted in the list , which is distinguished by a pious exterior, arises out of false teaching and characterizes the last time. The list of vices in MK. 7:20--23, coming after 7:18 f., serves to elucidate further the saying of Jesus about purity (7:15) for the Hellenistic Christian community. The substantive _hyperephania_ in 7:22 comes between _blasphemia_ [_blasphemy_] 'blasphemy' (of God) and _aphrosyne_ [_foolishness_] the ungodly attitude of fools … In the first instance _hyperephania_ to is against God and stands in contrast to the humility which is proper in relation to God and which is full surrender to Him. It is pride in one's own being and work which already in the OT tradition … denotes resistance to God and the haughty disdain with which others are treated." According to CD, _haughty_ is "unfriendly and seeming to consider yourself better than other people" and _disdain_ is defined "dislike of someone or something that you feel does not deserve your interest or respect."

**Hostility**,
ἔχθρα (_echthra_):
Gal. 5:20.
According to Foerster (TDNT 2:811--5), thus denotes "Of the related word groups … denotes the inner disposition from which hostility arises, i.e., 'hatred,' _exthra_ means 'hostility' as such, irrespective of the underlying disposition or of its manifestation or otherwise in visible form. … In the NT _exthra_ (in the plur. instances of _echthra_ ) as enmity between men is one of the works of the flesh along with _eris_, _zelos_, _thumos_." CD defines _hostility_ as "an occasion when someone is unfriendly or shows that they do not like something."

**Hubris**,
ὑβριστής (_hybristēs_):
Rom. 1:30; 1 Tim. 1:13.
In TDNT 8:295 cf. Bertram denotes "[A] _hybris_ is etym. obscure. The second syllable originally connected with _briaros_ 'weighty,' _britho_ 'heavily laden.' Popular etym., as already in Hom., derives it from _hyper_ along the lines of 'beyond measure.' This is linguistically impossible but important historically. With both noun and verb the range of meaning is very large. The noun means originally an act which invades the sphere of another to his hurt, a 'trespass,' a 'transgression' of the true norm in violation of divine and human right. Arrogance of disposition is often implied, … The ref. is to a wicked act, also insult, scorn, contempt, often accompanied by violence, rape, and mistreatment of all kinds. … The verb _hybrizo_, which is primarily trans. in formation, has the same range of meaning. … it denotes intr. arrogant conduct and trans. 'to harm,' 'damage,' 'injure,' … the injurious treatment of others even to rough handling. From the class. age it is also common in the pass.  _hybristes_, derived from the verb, denotes a man who, sinfully overestimating his own powers and exaggerating his own claims, is insolent in word and deed in relation to gods and men. … [A.4] In legal rhetoric one finds hubris technically from Aristoph. In trials the main issue is the violence of the rich against the poor, Lys., … One finds violation of personal rights and forceful interference in the personal or domestic sphere, … Aeschin. Tim., 15 tbe _hybreus graphe_ contains the law of injuries and violations which exerted considerable influence and shaped the similar law in Alexandria. … [A.6] With the mythical or philosophical usage of earlier times  (which continues to exert an influence) and with the legal use, one also finds new application in Aristot. In him, as earlier …, _hybris_ can be sexual violation, … As an expression of content _hybris_ means 'maltreatment' with _kataphronesis_ 'scorn' and _epereasmos_ 'ill-will,' … is also used act. for 'arrogance' as a form of _adikia_ … with _asebeia_ 'offense against gods and men' and _pleonexia_ … 'greed,' … Hubris in action is associated with pleasure, … The high-minded man is not to be confused with the arrogant, … To act arrogantly is very wrong, but hubris cannot be punished, for a presumptuous disposition is a gen. human complaint to which some  (the rich and young) are more prone and others less. … [A.7] The later period brings no essential changes … as already in Demosth. … _aselges_ and _hybrizon_ are synon. … characterizes the _hybristes_ as by nature prone to (mocking) laughter … speaks of hubris in intercourse … of hubris against the law … Thus hubris passed into common usage in many senses, some of them quite weak. It retains a certain emotional force as a poetic term. But in an age when more and more the problem of ethics and anthropology were being considered with the tools of rational thought this word which originally owed its content to myth could not become a tt. in philosophy. Hence hubris never became a key concept in Gk. thought. … [B.3] Since hubris is so broad and can denote disposition, attitude and conduct, sinful turning from or provocation of God, secularism, as well as vainglorious arrogance, encroachments and tyranny against one's fellows, it is very hard to fix the limits of signification whether over against synon. or related Gk. words or with ref. to the equivalent Hbr. roots. In fact many Hbr. roots stand close in sense to hubris or are in context an expression of it. Thus one may ref. to … 'to be great, lofty, exalted,' but also 'to be boastful, proud, arrogant.'" CD defines _hubris_ as "a way of talking or behaving that is too proud," and as "an extreme and unreasonable feeling of pride and confidence in yourself."

**Husband-murderer**,
ἀνδροφόνος (_androphonos_):
1 Tim 1:9.
Liddell describes "[#1] man-slaying … [#2] of women, murdering husbands." Manslayer is a crime of the worst sort. May the person doing this -- if a woman -- repent, and may her children forgive her. If a wife kills her husband, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented from it, including proven sound before the congregational elders.

**Hypocrisy**,
ὑπόκρισις (_hypokrisis_):
1 Pet. 2:1.
According to Danker, the term denotes "the idea of playing a role in a theatrical production extends by metonymy to the sphere of everyday life" but also mentions _pretense_. Thayer says _dissimulation_, and Liddell says _hypocrisy_, to which D. and T. agree. CD defines _hypocrisy_ as "pretending to be what you are not, or pretending to believe something that you do not."

**Idolater**,
εἰδωλολάτρης (_eidōlolatrēs_):
Eph. 5:5; 1 Cor. 5:10, 11, 6:9; Rev. 21:8, 22:15.
According to Liddell _an idol-worshipper_, _idolater_. The sinners cataloged in Eph. 5:5 -- πόρνος (_pornos_) i. male-sex-buyer ii. male-prostitute, ἀκάθαρτος (_akathartos_) foul (state), πλεονέκτης (_pleonektēs_) unscrupulous competition -- counts as idolaters. Also, see _idol worship_, _idol meat_, and _idolatry_.

**Idolatry**,
εἰδωλολατρία (_eidōlolatria_):
Gal 5:20; 1 Pet. 4:3.
According to Gingrich -- _idolatry_. The sins cataloged in Col. 3:5 -- πορνεία (_porneia_) prostitution, ἀκαθαρσία, (_akatharsia_) foul (conduct), πάθος (_pathos_) erotic perversion, ἐπιθυμία κακός (_epithymia kakos_) evil cravings, πλεονεξία (_pleonexia_) unscrupulous encroaching -- count as idolatry. Mentioned in 1 Cor. 10:7--8 as part of idolatry: to eat ἐσθίω (_esthiō_); to drink πίνω (_pinō_); to amuse παίζω (_paizō_) erotically or festively; to prostitute someone or oneself πορνεύω (_porneuō_) understood as selling sex. Conduct mentioned in 1 Cor. 10:18--21: to partner κοινωνός (_koinōnos_) with demons; to drink the cup ποτήριον (_potērion_) of demons; to eat from the table τράπεζα (_trapeza_) of demons. Thereby a rite, ceremony, or sacrifice. Also, see _idol worship_, _idol meat_, and _idolater_.

**Idol meat**,
εἰδωλόθυτος (_eidōlothytos_):
Acts: 15:20, 21:25.
According to Büchsel (TDNT 2:378--9), it denotes "… the meat which derives from heathen sacrifices, though without the intolerable implication of the sanctity of what is offered to heathen gods, or the divinity of gods. … Paul allow the enjoyment of _eidolothutos_ apart from the cultic act itself (1 Cor. 10:14--22) and so long as it does not violate the law of love (8:1--13). In this connection he appeals (10:26) to Ps. 24:1. He can take this attitude only because faith has overcome Jewish legalism from within. In the apostolic decree of  Acts 15:29; 21:25, and in Rev. 2:14, 20, we do not have full freedom from legalism. Among the Nicolaitans the desire the eat meat sacrificed to idols is an exception of Libertarianism, i.e., of complete renunciation of any commitment to the will of God, as may be seen from their general licentiousness. The same is probably true of Paul's opponents in Corinth." However, it is clear that we are not supposed to eat from an idol sacrifice, but if we eat a meal blindly and give thanks to God, we are free to eat by faith without consequence. See _idol worship_.

**Idol pollution**,
ἀλίσγημα εἴδωλον (_alisgēma eidōlon_):
Acts 15:20.
Liddell calls ἀλίσγημα _pollution_, technically pollution from idols. In total, the word group of ἀλισγέω, ἀλίσγημα, ἁλίσκομαι generally is about pollution. However, the last word, according to L. denotes "_to be taken_, _conquered_, of persons and places … _to fall in the hands of_ the enemy." Daniel decided in his heart that he didn't want to be polluted by the food and wine given by the king of Babylon (Dan. 1:8), further, Malachi orates prophetically that the people puts polluted things on his altar and despise his table (Mal. 1:7, 12). We are the living and holy sacrifice unto God in our daily service to the Lord (Rom. 12:1). By putting a defiled offering, ourselves, we profane the table of God. Therefore the believers should not profane themselves with what comes from the altar of idol worship, which has been polluted but abstain and keep from it (Acts 15:20). See _idol-worship_, _idol meat_, _idolater_, _idolatry_, also see _foul_.

**Idol worship**,
προσκυνέω ὁ εἴδωλον (_proskyneō ho eidōlon_):
Acts 15:20; Rev. 9:20.
According to Büchsel (TDNT 2:375--8), idol and idolatry can be well denoted "[#1] 1. _eid-olon_, from _eid-_, _vidare_, 'to see' … means 'picture' or 'copy,' whether artificially made, self-produced or simply present. Thus _eidolon_ might mean 'figure of a man' in the sense of a copy of the man depicted, but not the man himself. It can also be used for images of gods etc. On the other hand, the usual term for the cultic images of the Greeks is _agalma_, while the statues of men are normally called _andrias_ and _eikon_. The relevant cultic object as such is not _eidolon_, but the relation to the deity can be formulated in such way that it is  not _eidolon_. It helps us understand the Greek conception and sense of the word that they call reflections in water … and that they also call the shadow _eidolon skias_. _eidolon_ can also be used for shades or apparitions, and is par. to _phasma_. Indeed, the inhabitants of the underworld are called _eidola_, though they are no longer the men concerned, but only copies of them. A work of art is called _eidolon_ in the sense of an unconscious and immobile copy quite distinct from the living being in question. … _eidolon_ can also denote the image awakened by an object in the soul. It is common in Philo in the sense of what is unreal or deceptive. Though it would be too much to equate it with what is without substance, it certainly denotes 'copy' as distinct from the true reality. [#2] 2. The LXX uses _eidolon_ for many words meaning images of the gods or heathen deities … A first point to notice is that _eidolon_ rather than _agalma_ is used for images of gods. Even more important is that the term is applied to the gods themselves. Behind the usage there is obviously a polemic against paganism. The presence of the images as the focus of worship is used to emphasize the unreality of heathen belief and the heathen gods. For the Jews idols and heathen deities are identical, and they prove that the heathen have images but no true God. Thus 'copy' (as distinct from the reality) is the word for both images and gods. The word 'idol' in its current use does not always convey the precise meaning. Too great emphasis is often laid on the idea of an object of false worship rather than on that of something without reality which fools have put in the place of the true God. In its strict sense the idol is not merely an alternative god; it is an unreal god, and therefore false as distinct from true and real. Philo and Josephus are both familiar with this use of _eidolon_. … In pagan Gk. we do not find this usage. The Gks. did not share this view. For either they honor as gods what Jews call _eidolon_, or, even if they no longer do so, they have no comprehensive expression for what the Jews call _eidolon_. The language of the LXX is biblical or Jewish Gk. in this respect. Jewish religion has coined a new expression out of an existing term. … [#3] 3. The NT usage rests on that of the LXX or the Jews. In the NT _eidolon_ is used for heathen gods and their images. The word and its derivatives do not occur on the Gospels. … In relation to Paul's use of _eidolon_ the question arises how far he regards them as realities. It is evident from 1 Thess. 1:9 that they are _no gods_ [emphasis added] in comparison with God, and from Gal. 4:8 and Rom. 1:23 that they are _not divine_ [emphasis added] by nature but only products of human sin and folly. But he seems to _see demons behind their worship_ [emphasis added] (1 Cor. 10:19; cf. 8:5), so that we do not have here a purely intellectual dismissal. He gave full weight to Det. 32:17: _ethusan daimoniois kai ou theo_. In this respect he is wholly Jewish." Paul denotes that _idol worship_ or _idolatry_ is actual demon worship and is forbidden both in OT and NT. CD defines _worship_ as "to love, respect, and admire someone or something very much, often without noticing the bad qualities of that person or thing."

**Impious**,
ἀνόσιος (_anosios_):
1 Tim. 1:9; 2 Tim. 3:2.
According to Hauck (TDNT 5:492), mentions "…it occurs twice in the Past. for 'impious' persons who impiously reject sacred obligations. … but in 2 Tim. 3:2 the sequence … suggests the sense of 'impious,' 'devoid of piety.'" It seems that the difference to _irreverent_ is rather the skipping or negligence of basic NT biblical obligations to one's relatives and family prescribed by Jesus as expected in Christian conduct. CD defined _piety_ as "a strong belief in God or a religion, shown by your worship and behavior." When failing to do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Irreconcilable**,
ἄσπονδος (_aspondos_):
2 Tim. 3:3.
Liddell denotes "a keeping out of treaty or covenant with others … admitting of no truce." Also, Thayer connotes "without a treaty or covenant; of things not mutually agreed upon, e. g. abstinence from hostilities … without a treaty or covenant; of things not mutually agreed upon, e. g. abstinence from hostilities." Finally, Gingrich says _irreconcilable_. CD defines the said as "impossible to find agreement between or with, or impossible to deal with."

**Irreverent**,
ἀσεβής (_asebēs_):
1 Tim. 1:9.
According to Foerster (TDNT 7:185--7), for the pagans, irreverence meant "In Athenian trials for _asebia_ non-belief in the gods in which the _polis_ believes is called _adikein_ … all private cults are to be forbidden under the law of _asebia_… As long as the ancient _polis_ endured _asebia_, the failure to worship the city gods, was a breach of its order. Taking part in the national cult was _eusebeia_, refusal to do so _asebeia_. To the end of antiquity, then, an important part of _eusebeia_ or _asebeia_ was participation in the national cult or refusal to do this." Also, for the pagans, "As _eusebeia_ developed from reverence for the gods and the orders protected by them to worship of the gods, so _asebeia_ developed from a lack of reverence for the gods  to neglect of the cultus." For the Jews, irreverence could be "With _asebes_ there is never any more precise indication of obj. This does not mean that only God is the direct object of _aseb-_. A first pt. to notice is that _aseb-_ never denotes a mere attitude but always action, conduct. Hence _asebeia_ can often be put in the plur. as issue of specific acts. If the obj. is indicated only with the verb _asebeo_, this is the more surprising in that the group is not used only for cultic or particularly religious acts. A false witness speaks _asebeia_ … _asebes_ means one who is guilty in the judgment … _asebeo_ means transgression of judicial directions." CD defines _irreverent_ as "lacking the expected respect for official, important, or holy things." Biblically _irreverent_ means conduct against God that is not worthy to call worship, because their hands do not conduct what their tongues confess (Jam 1: 22--25). When failing to do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Kidnapper**,
see _oppressor_, secondary meaning of _andrapodistēs_. Also see _fraudster_ from _κλέπτης_, as about man-stealing or, abduction.

**Killing**,
φόνος (_phonos_):
Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:21;  Rom. 1:29; 1 Tim. 1:9.
According to Liddell, there is a long denotation, but Thayer, Gingrich, and Danker may together shortly denote _murder_, _homicide_, _slaughter_, _killing_, and _execution_. Then L. shortly denotes "murder, slaughter, … exact vengeance for the killing … killing or not-killing, … the murder of … slaughter of Greeks, … in law, murder, homicide, death as a punishment, … blood when shed, gore, … of a sacrifice, … rarely in Prose of blood, … corpse, … rascal that deserves death, gallowsbird, a Dorian phrase, … of the agent or instrument of slaughter, … to be a death to heroes, … of poison." It seems that partaking in the death penalty as an executioner could count as the sin of killing. Also, may it be prohibited to carry out a lethal action as of non-death penalty. However, whether causing a killing by self-defense of home, wife, or children and assaulting a burglar in one's own home may be said to count as exceptions thereof. Mat. 15:19 and Mar. 7:21, which mentions an inner evil contemplation of killing in one’s heart, also counts as sin.

**Lawless**,
ἄνομος (_anomos_):
1 Tim. 1:9.
According to Gutbrod (TDNT 4:1086), the meaning is “having no law.” In 1 Cor. 9:21, Paul instructs: “I become lawless unto the lawless -- I am not without God’s law but legal in Christ -- to gain those without any law (NA28; my translation).” Technically even if Paul gained those without law by adapting to them, he never overlooked the Law of Christ. The big problem arises when someone disregards the worldly and the divine law simultaneously and thus becomes truly lawless. When people do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not become lawful.

**Liar**,
ψεύστης (_pseustēs_):
1 Tim. 1:10.
In John 14:6, we need to know that Jesus claims to be the truth with capital T. In John 8:44, The Devil is the father of lies with capital L. Technically, the term ψεύστης is used only 10 times in the NT, mostly by John and secondly by Paul. It is only used in contrast between the  truth of God and the lies of the Devil. All truthfulness is in regard to the Kingdom of God and Jesus with the Gospel. Conzelmann (TDNT 9:594 A.1.f) denotes the correct use of ψεύστης in profane greek as _liar_. But the meaning thereof is far away from protestant and catholic state religious connotation, instead, C. describes "Lying cannot be viewed merely as the opposite of truth. Basic to the general and philosophical use of the word group is the twofold sense, namely, objective and subjective appearance, untruth as non-breaking and error as false judgment of reality. The norm of the ethical assessment of lying is the firm bond between _aletheia_ and _dike_. At issue is the divinely protected order of the world." Further, C. states "Hence the worst lie is perjury … Subj. values enter in here. Lying esp. direct lying against others i.e., 'calumniation' _diabole_, is alien to the good man … It deprives honor and is an assault on human dignity … The aristocratic order demands esp. that one should not deceive those to whom one owes respect, … On the other hand the gods deceive (_dolos_) men." CD defines _lie_ as "to say or write something that is not true in order to deceive someone," and _liar_ as "someone who tells lies." When lying, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not stop it.

**Loving pleasure rather than loving God**,
φιλήδονος μᾶλλον ἤ φιλόθεος (_philēdonos mallon ē philotheos_):
2 Tim. 3:4.
Liddell, Thayer and Gingrich are confluent in _loving/fond of pleasure_, As well as _loving God_. Thereby the construction of whether a person loves God with their whole heart or has pleasures higher than him.

**Lunacy**,
ἀνόητος (_anoētos_):
Tit. 3:3.
According to Behm (TDNT 4:961), is being "'unthought of', 'unsuspected,' 'unintelligible' … this word is predominantly act. 'unwise,' 'irrational,' 'foolish' … both intellectually and ethically, of persons lacking in understanding or judgment … whose folly is manifested in their acts, … but also of subjects, human thoughts, utterances etc." CD defines _deranged_ as "completely unable to think clearly or behave in a controlled way, especially because of mental illness." Specifically, defines _lunacy_ as "stupid behavior that will have bad results," and "extreme foolishness or mental illness"

**Magician**,
φάρμακος (_pharmakos_):
Rev. 21:8, 22:15.
Liddell denotes "a poisoner, sorcerer, magician," to which both Thayer and Gingrich agree. Danker defines _magician_ as "an expert in manipulation through occult means." See _witchcraft_.

**Maleficent contriver**,
ἐφευρετής κακός (_epheuretēs kakos_):
Rom. 1:30.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree that ἐφευρετής means both _inventor_, as well as _contriver_. Then κακός means _maleficent_. According to CD _inventor_ is described "someone who has invented something or whose job is to invent things," and _contrive_ is described "to arrange a situation or event, or arrange for something to happen, using clever planning." Technically we are talking about persons, which are maleficent, trying to invent harm and evil, and making it come true, wickedness personified in human beings. See _malevolence_, also _maleficent eye_.

**Maleficent craving**,
ἐπιθυμία κακός (_epithymia kakos_):
Col. 3:5.
Maleficent cravings are mentioned in Prov. 21:26 in the LXX, they count as idolatry. Cravings to cause harm to oneself or others. See _idolatry_, _craving_, and _malevolence_, also _evil_, _maleficent eye_.

**Maleficent eye**,
ὀφθαλμός πονηρός (_ophthalmos ponēros_):
Mar. 7:22.
In TDNT (5:375), Michaelis denotes that ὀφθαλμός means "first 'apple of the eye,' then 'eye,'" further, πονηρός means _evil_, totally, _apple of the maleficent eye_. See _evil_, also _malevolence_, _malice_, _maleficent craving_.

**Male-prostitute**,
see _male-sex-buyer_, secondary meaning of _pornos_.

**Male-sex-buyer**,
πόρνος (_pornos_):
1 Tim. 1:10; Eph. 5:5; 1 Cor. 5:10, 11, 6:9; Heb. 12:16, 13:4.
According to Hauck/Schulz (TDNT 6:580), "_pornos_ … 'whoremonger' who has intercourse with prostitutes then specifically one who lets himself be used for money, 'male prostitute'" There is no word in CD regarding male sexual immoral conduct. When men purchase sex, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away and repent for it.

**Malevolence**,
κακία (_kakia_):
Rom. 1:29; Eph. 4:31; Tit. 3:3; Col. 3:8; 1 Pet. 2:1.
To understand κακία we first much understand κακός. According to Grundmann (TDNT 3:469), κακός denotes as "The word _kakos_, already considered in relation to _agathos_, expresses the presence of the lack. It is not positive; it is an incapacity or weakness. Like 'evil,' it has more than purely moral significance . The wealth expressed in the developing concepts … Thus _kakos_ means a. 'mean,' 'unserviceable,' 'incapable,' 'poor of its kind,' … Greater precision is attained  by additions. … It also means b. 'morally bad,' 'wicked.' … It then means c. 'weak.' … A final meaning d. is 'unhappy,' 'bad,' 'ruinous,' 'evil.' … This fixes the meaning of the noun _to kakon_, _ta kaka_, 'evil,' 'suffering,' 'misfortune,' 'ruin.'" Maleficent as a concept based on being mean and harmful by ignorance and incompetence causing suffering and ruin. CD describes _maleficent_ as "bad or harmful." The said word κακία, then according to G. (TDNT 3:482) denotes "This word is related to _kakon_ … It is the quality of a _kakos_, and it can also signify the outworking of this quality, sometimes in the plural." CD describes _malevolence_ as "the quality of causing or wanting to cause harm or evil."

**Malice**,
κακοήθεια (_kakoētheia_):
Rom. 1:29.
According to Grundmann (TDNT 3:485), the current term denotes "It always means 'wickedness,' 'malice.' In the NT it occurs only at R. 1:29 … The series shows that it is here conscious and intentional wickedness." Technically it is the intention to act in malignity towards  someone. CD describes _malice_ as "the intention to do something wrong and esp. to cause injury."

**Miscomprehension**,
ἀσύνετος (_asynetos_):
Rom. 1:31.
According to Conzelmann (TDNT 7:), it denotes "The adj. _sunetos_ (similarly _asunetos_) means act. 'understanding' … pass. 'understandable' … Like the verb and noun it need closer definition … The charge of lack of understanding may have moral tinge," The said term is negative as in lack of understanding. CD defines _miscomprehension_ as "failure to understand something, or an idea that is wrong because it is based on a lack of understanding."

**Mockery**,
see _blasphemy (conduct)_, rather used against humans than God.

**Money-phile**,
φιλάργυρος (_philargyros_):
2 Tim. 3:2.
All Danker, Thayer and Liddell connotes _fond of money_. _avaricious_, therefore the closest we get is _avaricious_ described by CD as "showing an extremely strong wish to get or keep money or possessions," and _fond of_ as "happy and loving," also _greed_ as "a strong desire to continually get more of something, esp. money."

**Mother-murderer**,
μητρολῴας (_mētrolōas_):
1 Tim. 1:9.
Liddell describes "striking one's mother, a matricide." CD defines _matricide_ as "a crime in which a person kills their mother." If anyone kills their mother, they have committed murder. If anyone kills their parent, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the thing, including proven sound before the congregational elders.

**Murderer**,
φονεύς (_phoneus_):
Rev. 21:8, 22:15.
Liddell connotes "slayer, … self-murderers, … is so much more justly accounted a murderer, Antipho 4.3.3 … of the sword on which Ajax had thrown himself, … even of a woman, … you, my destroyer." Also, Thayer and Gingrich say _murderer_. It is highly important to understand that this also benefits the self-murderers, they also count in. In most eschatology, murderers end up in the lake of burning fire and brimstone, but also those that may die in that state as of heavenly exclusion. Also see _killing_.

**Nests (multiple)**,
κοίταις (_koitais_, plural):
Rom 13:13.
κοίτη in singular according to Liddell means among others: _bedstead_, _marriage-bed_, _of one dead_, _lair_ of a wild beast, a _nest_ of a bird, of the spider, of the fish, _pen_, _fold_ for cattle, _act of going to bed_, _of sexual connection_. A very related word of Liddell is κοῖτος which means: _resting-place_, _bed of birds_, _stall_, _fold_, _pen_.  κοίτη itself should not be mistaken for sinful conduct but is used regarding many righteous men and women in the bible, even if not married. It is conclusive that κοῖτος originally was about the nightly protection in the era of the stone-age. Animals and people pursued a nightly place to live and defend. Some animals live in pairs and build a common κοίτη. The same thing with humans a man and woman cooperate for nightly protection, and around that place, builds or furnish what they call home. Technically it’s a shared bed around which the whole household builds up. Think of it from the point of view of a birdnest, two birds builds a nest in which they mate, lay eggs, raises chicks, and sleep in it, everything contrary to other animals that do not have a monogamous relationship with their peers. In 2 Sam. 11:13, Uriah goes back to his _nest_ to sleep for the second time -- the LXX uses the word κοίτη here. In Gen. 49:4, Reuben did climb his father Israel's _nest_ by sleeping with his wife. Rom. 9:10 says "not only but except even Rebecca out of one _nest_ conceived, with our father Isaac (NA28; my translation)." Technically κοίτη as _nest_ is in itself normal human conduct. However, with many cohabitations -- wedded or not -- it’s sinful polygamy. CD defines _nest_ as "to build a nest, or live in a nest," and "a structure or other place where creatures, esp. birds, give birth or leave their eggs to develop." Also, CD defines _polygamy_ as "the custom or condition of being married to more than one person at the same time."

**Oppressor**,
ἀνδραποδιστής (_andrapodistēs_):
1 Tim. 1:10.
According to Liddell and Gingrich, both say _kidnapper_ and _slave-dealer_, Thayer goes further and explains "(from ἀνδραποδίζω, and this from τό ἀνδράποδον -- from ἀνήρ and πούς -- a slave, a man taken in war and sold into slavery), a _slave-dealer_, _kidnapper_, _man-stealer_, i. e. as well one who unjustly reduces free men to slavery, as one who steals the slaves of others and sells them." CD defines _oppressor_ as "someone who treats people in an unfair and cruel way and prevents them from having opportunities and freedom." Further, _kidnapper_ as "someone who takes a person away illegally by force, usually in order to demand money in exchange for releasing them." Finally, _trafficker_ as "a person who buys and sells goods or people illegally." If anyone oppresses, kidnaps, or traffics somebody, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the oppression, including proven sound before the congregational elders.

**Outburst**,
θυμός (_thymos_):
Gal. 5:20; Eph. 4:31; 2 Cor. 12:20; Col. 3:8.
According to Büchsel (TDNT 3:167), said term denotes "From the sense of 'to well up,' 'to boil up,' there seems to have developed that of 'to smoke,' and then 'to cause to go up in smoke,' 'to sacrifice.' The basic meaning of _thumos_ is thus similar to that of _pneuma_, namely, 'that which is moved and which moves,' 'vital force.' … _thumos_ then takes on the meaning sense of a. desire, impulse, inclination, b. spirit, c. anger, d. sensibility, e. disposition or mind, f. thought, consideration. … [for the writers] For them _thumos_ means spirit, anger, rage, agitation." According to CD, _outburst_  defines as "a sudden forceful expression of emotion, especially anger."

**Outcry**,
see _clamor_, secondary meaning of _kraugē_, a single loud group complaint.

**Overindulgence**,
ἡδονή (_hēdonē_):
Tit. 3:3.
Stählin (TDNT 2:909 cf) denotes "… The word _hedone_ derives from the same root as _hedus_, 'sweet,' 'pleasant,' 'delightful' … and it shares with this adj. the original sense of what is pleasant to the senses, namely, to the sense of taste. … of superficial 'pleasure in rhetoric' (feasting the ears). The narrower basic meaning, which relates to what tastes good, was accompanied for many centuries by a subsidiary semasiological strand according to which _hedone_ denotes that which causes pleasure to the senses. The specific sense of 'pleasant taste' is first found in … Already in its earliest use, however, the term _hedone_ bears the broader sense of a general 'feeling of pleasure' or 'enjoyment.' The development from the sensual to the physical and then to the ethical, which we can trace in _hedone_, is often to be noted in the evolution of words and their meanings. Already at an early period the rise of a feeling of pleasure is both restricted to sensual perceptions but is linked with enjoyable experiences of all kinds, and esp. with desired communications." Liddell connotes to earlier mentioned "_enjoyment_, _pleasure_, … prop. of sensual pleasures, … of _malicious pleasure_, … to give way _to pleasure_, … shall I speak truly or _so as to humor you?_ … one feels _pleasure_ at the thought that … to be _satisfied with_ … to speak so as to please another, … it is a _pleasure_ or _delight_ to another, … to take _pleasure_ in them, … with pleasure, … concrete, _a pleasure_, … sweetmeats, … _desires after pleasure_, _pleasant lusts_." According to the Bible, illicit gratification is harmful to your walk with God (Luk. 8:14). CD describes _hedonism_ as "living and behaving in ways that mean you get as much pleasure out of life as possible, according to the belief that the most important thing in life is to enjoy yourself," also _overindulgence_ as "behavior in which you allow someone to have more of something enjoyable than is good for them."

**Perjured**,
ἐπίορκος (_epiorkos_):
1 Tim. 1:10.
According to J. Schneider (TDNT 5:466), it states "to commit perjury," as well as "to swear falsely." When it comes to perjury, J. S. states "1 Tim. 1:8 ff. deals with the relation of the Christian and the Law. To the righteous man, i.e. the justified man set in a new life, the requirement of the Law does not apply. Only where sins arise, which are enumerated in a catalog of vices in v. 9 and v. 10, are the strictness and severity of the Law relevant. Perjurers are among the enemies of the Law and the gainsayers." According to Jesus, we are supposed (Mat. 5:33--37) not to swear at all, instead let yes be yes and no be no, accordingly also at liberty to remain silent, not engage or avoid. CD defines _perjured_ as "false, in a way that involves perjury (= telling lies in court)." When doing so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Polygamy**,
see _nests (multiple)_.

**Potions**,
see _witchcraft_, another meaning of _pharmakeia_.

**Pretender**,
see _wannabe_, secondary meaning of _alazōn_.

**Prostitution**,
πορνεία (_porneia_):
Gal. 5:19; Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:21; Eph 5:3; 2 Cor. 12:21; Col. 3:5; Acts 15:20, 21:25; Rev. 9:21.
According to Hauck/Schulz (TDNT 6:580), "_porne_ from _pernemi_ 'to sell,' esp. of slaves, means lit. 'harlot for hire,' 'prostitute'; Gk. harlots were usually bought slaves … _pornos_ … 'whoremonger' who has intercourse with prostitutes then specifically one who lets himself be used for money, 'male prostitute' … _porneia_ … rare in class Gk., 'fornication' … _moicheuo_ is narrower than _porneia_ and refers solely to adultery." According to Liddell the following words beginning with πορν- means: πορνεία _prostitution_, πορνεῖον _brothel_, πορνεύω "_prostitute_, mostly in Pass., of a woman, _prostitute herself, be or become a prostitute_," πόρνη "_harlot_, _prostitute_," πορνικός "_of or for harlots_, … the tax _paid by brothel-keepers_," πορνοβοσκέω "_keep a brothel_," πορνοβοσκία "_trade of a brothel-keeper_," πορνοβοσκός _brothel-keeper_, πορνοφίλας or πορνο-φίλης "_loving-harlots_," πορνο-διδάσκαλος "_teacher of fornication_," πορνο-γέννητος "_born of harlots_," πορνο-γράφος "_wiritng of harlots_," πορνο-κοπέω "_to be a whoremonger_," πορνο-κοπία _whoremongering_, πορνο-κόπος "_one who has commerce with prostitutes_, _fornicator_," πορνο-μανής "_mad after prostitutes_," πόρνος "_catamite_, _sodomite_, _fornicator_," πορνο-τελώνης "_farmer of the_ [brothel], _tax-gatherer_." A lot of bible translations use the word _fornication_ which stems from the Latin. Lewis & Short says: fornix "_a brothel, bagnio, stew_, situated in underground vaults," fornĭcātĭo "_whoredom_, _fornication_," fornĭcātor _fornicator_, fornĭcor "_to commit whoredom_ or _fornication_," fornĭcātrix "_a fornicatress_, prostitute." It is clear that _fornication_ comes from _prostitution_, and everything related to πορν- is brothel activity and nothing else. Therefore it should be obvious that πορνεία is the activity of a man paying for the performance of prostitutive acts and nothing else. Prostitution has come to be a derogatory term for those not practicing brothel activity but those that refuse religious _sexual asceticism_ and similar. CD defines _prostitution_ as "the business of having sex for money." (It seems like CD has removed the act of a man buying a prostitute from the dictionary.)

**Quarrel**,
ἔρις (_eris_):
Gal. 5:20; Rom. 1:29; 2 Cor. 12:20.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich connote _strife_, _quarrel_, and _contention_, _wrangling_. It is  distinct from διχοστασία (_dichostasia_) _disunity_. It is rather about rivalry. CD says "violent or angry disagreement," about _strife_, "to have an angry disagreement with someone" about _quarrel_, and "to have an angry disagreement with someone" of _contention_. L. also mentions _rivalry_ described as "a serious and often continuing competition." It is about an open conflict regarding the upper hand or rivalry, doctrinal or usual but not _disunity_ as in settling with a side.

**Rage**,
ὀργή (_orgē_):
1 Tim. 2:8; Col. 3:8.
According to Kleinknecht (TDNT 5:383--4 A.I), "_orge_, post-Homeric, first found in Hes. Op., 304, then common in poetry and prose, is related in stem to _orgao_/_orgas_, and thus means the 'lavish swelling of sap and vigor,' 'thrusting and upsurging' in nature, originally gener. [#1] a. the 'impulsive nature' of man or beast, esp. the impulsive state of the human disposition, which in contrast to more inward and quiet _ethos_ … breaks forth actively in relation to what it is without. When _orge_ is used of the mind and nature of man, animal and other comparisons point expressly to the natural side of the concept … The female type which god [lower cased] created the fox … another is best likened to the changeable sea in its nature … The character of men are distinct … who sets _orge_, man's natural disposition, character and bent, in the category as his … In the general and broader sense of individual nature or disposition _orge_ is esp. important in Attic tragedy where it became a tragic element.  In _orge_ there is actualized the true or false insight of man which impels him to decisive deeds … Not blind anger, but demonic excess [Greek] of will in the nature of the tragic person, goes hand in hand with _ananke_, necessity and fate. As compared with older use, _orge_ in tragedy has already become more restricted and specialized. _orge_ now has more of the sense of a specific reaction of the human soul. It takes on the sense [#2] b. of anger as the most striking manifestation of powerful inner passion _thumos_. The two terms can now supplement one other … and yet on the other hand  _orge_, in distinction from _thumos_, is essentially and intentionally oriented to its content, namely, revenge or punishment … In virtue of this _orge_ itself acquired the meaning [#3] c. 'punishment'." Totally, rage can be impulsive on the outside like an _outburst_, however, on the inside, being long gone anger over unsettled issues and from the inside being intentional. CD describes _payback_ as "an action that punishes someone for something bad that the person did to you; revenge." Also, _revenge_ as "harm that you do to someone as a punishment for harm that the person has done to you," finally, _rage_ as "extreme or violent anger, or a period of feeling such anger."

**Rashness**,
προπετής (_propetēs_):
2 Tim. 3:4.
Both Thayer and Gingrich agree in common on _rash_ and _reckless_ and then differentiate on __precipitate_ and _thoughtless_. While Liddell gives a deeper insight, first the cognate προπέτομαι _fly forwards_, then the word denotes "out of control, … thrown away, … drooping, at the point of death, … untimely, … ready for, prone to a thing, … headlong, … precipitate, rash, reckless, … uncontrolled laughter, … of a lot, drawn at random, … of persons, … headlong, out of control, … headlong, hastily, … prematurely," CD defines _rashness_ as "the quality of being careless or unwise, without thought for what might happen or result."

**Rebellious**,
ἀνυπότακτος (_anypotaktos_):
1 Tim. 1:9.
According to Delling (TDNT 8:47), it denotes “not subject,” “free,” and “not subjected to specific (here geographical) ideas.” It means exactly “‘not subjecting’ oneself to sound teaching or its proponents (Tit. 1:9--10).” Also, in context “‘not submissive’ either in practice or principle. Here too, as in current usage, it has the sense of ‘rebellious’ or ‘refractory’ against God’s will (1 Tim. 1:9).” According to CD, _refractory_ is “not affected by a treatment, change, or process.” Also, _rebellious_ is defined as “If a group of people are rebellious, they oppose the ideas of the people in authority and plan to change the system, often using force.” When people rebel, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not submit.

**Revel**,
κῶμος (_kōmos_):
Gal. 5:21; 1 Pet. 4:3.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich basically agree on _revelry_ and _carousal_. By analyzing the contexts given in L. it's found: "ὅσος ἦν ἐν τῷ ἄστεϊ σῖτος καὶ ἑωυτοῦ καὶ ἰδιωτικός, τοῦτον πάντα συγκομίσας ἐς τὴν ἀγορὴν προεῖπε Μιλησίοισι, ἐπεὰν αὐτὸς σημήνῃ, τότε πίνειν τε πάντας καὶ _κώμῳ_ χρᾶσθαι ἐς ἀλλήλους." translated as "he brought together into the marketplace all the food in the city, from private stores and his own, and told the men of Miletus all to _drink and celebrate_ together when he gave the word," from 3Hdt.1.21. Contextually a negotiator offers a truce, then collects everything eatable and drinkable for a big public festivity doing an official saying. "νόμους δὲ καὶ ψηφίσματα λεγόμενα ἢ γεγραμμένα οὔτε ὁρῶσιν οὔτε ἀκούουσι: σπουδαὶ δὲ ἑταιριῶν ἐπ᾽ ἀρχὰς καὶ σύνοδοι καὶ δεῖπνα καὶ σὺν αὐλητρίσι _κῶμοι_," translates as "and the strivings of political clubs after public offices, and meetings, and banquets, and _revelings_ with chorus girls" from Pl.Tht.173d. Contextually a poem or so about the majesty of a great city with its revellings and beautiful flute-girls. "οἶμαι γὰρ τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο ἑορταὶ γίγνονται παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς καὶ _κῶμοι_ καὶ θάλειαι καὶ ἑταῖραι καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα πάντα, ὧν ἂν Ἔρως τύραννος ἔνδον οἰκῶν διακυβερνᾷ τὰ τῆς ψυχῆς ἅπαντα," translates as "for, I take it, next there are among them feasts and carousals and _revelings_ and courtesans and all the doings of those whose souls are entirely swayed by the indwelling tyrant Eros," from Id.R.573d. Contextually a fest to Eros with diverse celebration, indwelling of a tyrant as demon possession together with, among others, temple-prostitutes. "κωμάζει γὰρ ἡ πόλις πᾶσα τῇδε τῇ νυκτί," translates partially "in view of the revelry, it would not be at all surprising if the gates leading to the palace were open, for all the city is feasting this night," from X.Cyr.7.5.25. Contextually there is ongoing revelry in the palace, and the whole city is feasting all night. In total κῶμος is a festivity that builds on making pacts jointly with feasting and carousal publicly where the whole city is involved. That is an occult public celebration of a pact, or an occult covenant, which is statewide. Often sensuality and maybe even prostitution is common, especially with _hetairas_ temple prostitutes. CD describes _revel_ as "to dance, drink, sing, etc. at a party or in public, especially in a noisy way," and _festival_ as "a special day or period, usually in memory of a religious event, with its own social activities, food, or ceremonies."

**Revenge**,
see _rage_, the secondary meaning of _orgē_.

**Rivalry**,
see _quarrel_, secondary meaning of _eris_.

**Sectarianism**,
αἵρεσις (_hairesis_):
Gal. 5:20.
Danker describes it as a choice of association based on shared principles or beliefs, ordinarily of a subgroup with views or beliefs that deviate in certain respects from those of a larger party. Usually, there are religious or schismatic sects that rise in heresy and cause divisions in the Body of Christ contrary to the gospel. Schlier (TDNT 1:181) adds that αἵρεσις denotes names for both _teachings_ and _schools_. For a group to exist the required aspects are usually a comprehensive gathering in the group, a self-chosen authority of a teacher, and an authoritarian doctrine that is well-disputable compared to the Word of God. Thayer inclines that the verb form αἱρέω denotes _the act of taking capture_, _the storming of a city_. From that, it’s conclusive that unnecessary divisions in a group are about making a coup based on disputably misunderstood teachings. CD defines _sectarianism_ as “very strong support for the religious or political group that you are a member of, which can cause problems between different groups.”

**Selfishness**,
φίλαυτος (_philautos_):
2 Tim. 3:2.
According to Liddell, the term denotes "with affection concentrated on on oneself." Then, Thayer and Gingrich agree on _selfish_. CD defines _selfish_ as "caring only about what you want or need without any thought for the needs or wishes of other people."

**Selfish triumph**,
ἀφιλάγαθος (_aphilagathos_):
2 Tim. 3:3.
First, we describe the opposite φιλάγαθος, according to Grundmann (TDNT 1:18) describes "Aristotle calls _philagathos_ the man who, in contrast to the _philautos_ who is _phaulos_, places his ego under the good." The said term is denoted according to G. "This word is distinguished from _philautos_ (the opposite of  _philagathos_),  the term which introduces the description, in the sense  that it says of _philautoi_ that as men who know only themselves they seem to have no knowledge of live or piety. It is part of the NT description of the last time that in it lovelessness celebrates its triumph." Usually translated as _no love of good_. However, it could be settings oneself above the love of excellence, which is ego over what is good. People look away from the common good for their selfish desire. CD defines _selfish_ as "caring only about what you want or need without any thought for the needs or wishes of other people." And _triumph_ as "to have a very great success or victory."

**Self-seeking**,
ἐριθεία (_eritheia_):
Gal. 5:20; 2 Cor. 12:20.
According to Büchsel (TDNT 2:660--1), said term denotes "_eritheia_ comes from _eritheuo_, 'to work as a day-labourer,' 'to conduct oneself as such,' 'to work for daily hire,' and this again comes from _erithos_, a 'day-labourer.' _eritheia_ thus means the 'work,' then the 'manner, attitude or disposition of the day-labourer.' … here are those who procure office by illegal manipulation, and therefore _eritheia_ is their attitude, i.e., not so much _ambitus_ as a action, but the personal manner connected with it … The adj. is used in the same sense in the civic oath of the Italians: … 'I will not on any pretext bring a charge of failure to keep civic law against any citizen for personal reasons.' _erithiotan_, the crucial point of the oath, defines such charges as unobjective and self-seeking. … He thus demands that leaders should be non-contentious and without personal ambition. … Eze. 23:5 … v. 11 _eritheia_ (LXX: _epithesis_),  of a harlot who offers herself to a man or who entices him. _eritheia_ is thus the attitude of self-seekers, harlots etc., i.e., those who demeaning themselves and their cause, are busy and active in their own interest, seeking their own gain or advantage. … For many it probably had no more than the general sense of baseness, self-interest, ambition, contention. … For this reason, it is best to understand _eritheia_ as 'base self-seeking,' or simply as 'baseness,' the nature of those who cannot lift their gaze to higher things." CD defines _baseness_ as "a lack of any honor or morals," also _self-seeking_ as "interested in your own advantage in everything that you do."

**Sensuality**,
CD describes _sensuality_ as "the expression or suggestion of physical, especially sexual, pleasure or satisfaction," see _overindulgence_, the narrower meaning of _hēdonē_.

**Sex-purchase**,
see _prostitution_.

**Sex-slander**,
εὐτραπελία (_eutrapelia_):
Eph. 5:4.
Liddell mentions " wit, liveliness, Lat. urbanitas, … 2. in bad sense, jesting, ribaldry, N.T." Then Thayer says "(from εὐτράπελος, from εὖ, and τρέπω to turn: easily turning; nimble-witted, witty, sharp), pleasantry, humor, facetiousness … in a bad sense, scurrility, ribaldry, low jesting (in which there is some acuteness): Eph. 5:4; in a milder sense." Also Gingrich mentions _coarse jesting_, _buffoonery_, then Danker mention _suggestive_, _risqué talk_. CD describes _wit_ as "the ability to use words in a clever and humorous way," and _risqué_ as "(of jokes or stories) slightly rude or shocking, especially because of being about sex," even _suggestive_ as "often used to describe something that makes people think about sex." The overall feeling is the negative understanding of some sexual undertones and probably very derogatory language in presence of others to be hit or disturbed by such a manner. Sweet talk in front of others for the sake of burning down a relationship, is also probable. CD describes _sexist_ as "suggesting that the members of one sex are less able, intelligent, etc. than the members of the other sex, or referring to that sex's bodies, behavior, or feelings in a negative way."

**She-devil**,
διάβολος (_diabolos_):
1 Tim. 3:11; 2 Tim. 3:3.
According to Foerster (TDNT 2:71--81), said meaning in Greek is "have the sense of 'separating' … 'to separate from.' Hence the passive: 'to be set in opposition to someone,' 'to hate or be hated by him' … This leads quite easily to the sense of 'to accuse' as in the orator Antiphon … In the first instance, of course, _diaballein_ does not mean judicial accusation, but the hostile will expressed in complaints and reproaches, and therefore denunciation. … Often, however, it is hard to distinguish, between _diaballein_ and 'to calumniate' … This leads us to many further meanings. e.g., 'to repudiate' … 'to misrepresent' … 'to give false information' … and esp. 'to deceive.'" F. mentions in the NT "In 1 Tim. 3:11… and 2 Tim. 3:3 … the word has the predominant Gk. sense of 'calumniator.'" Predominantly about  women in general as well as female deacons. Nothing of being a devil here relates to satan as an entity but human behavior and conduct. CD defines _calumny_ as "(the act of making) a statement about someone that is not true and is intended to damage the reputation of that person," also _devilish_ as "evil or morally bad," but _devil_ as "a person who enjoys doing things people might disapprove of," and _she-devil_ as "a woman who is considered to be dangerous or evil."

**Sinner**,
ἁμαρτωλός (_hamartōlos_):
1 Tim. 1:9.
According to Rengstorf (TDNT 1:317), ἁμαρτωλός denotes the core connotation as ἁμαρτία which is “not hitting,” “missing,” “the man who misses something,” and ἁμαρτωλός specifically "sinner," “when he misses something.” Except that there is no satisfying or distinguishing utility to explain such properly. Here we must explicitly rely on the context of 1 Tim. 1:9. The context says that the mosaic law is for those sinners but can impossibly refer to sinners of the mosaic law itself. Therefore only the Law of Christ (1 Cor. 9:21, Gal. 6:2) in the NT can be applicable (Mat. 22:35--40, John 13:24). When failing to do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Slanderer**,
κατάλαλος (_katalalos_):
Rom. 1:30.
The one performing slander, see _slander_.

**Slander**,
καταλαλιά (_katalalia_):
2 Cor. 12:20; 1 Pet. 2:1.
This word group, according to Kittel (TDNT 4:4), stands in contrast to _sordid calumny_ as _unthinking gossip_ as the big difference. Except that it is "to importune someone with speeches," "to prattle something to someone," and also "to speak against, to accuse, someone," but is most likely common everyday slander. CD defines _slander_ as "statements that someone makes about another person that are not true and that harm their reputation, or the crime of making these statements."

**Sordid calumny**,
αἰσχρολογία (_aischrologia_):
Col. 3:8.
Stems from two words: αἰσχρός _sordid_, and λόγος which according to Debrunner (TDNT 4:73) aims for _assembling_, _reckoning_, _account_, _review_, and _narrative_. Delling (TDNT 4:4) describes the contrast of καταλαλιά which is: "evil report" and "calumny" as "malicious or unthinking gossip." Thereby sordid accusations or evil thought-through slander cunningly planted. CD defines sordid _calumny_ as "(the act of making) a statement about someone that is not true and is intended to damage the reputation of that person." Also, _see sordid_. Simply calumny that portrays someone as sordid or shameful.

**Sordid gain**,
αἰσχροκερδής (_aischrokerdēs_):
1 Tim. 3:8; Tit. 1:7.
Stems from two words: αἰσχρός _sordid_, and κέρδος, which according to Schlier (TDNT 3:672) means _to gain_, _advantage_, _profit_, also _crafty counsels_ and _cunning_. Further, Liddell states: _sordidly greedy for gain_, and Thayer states: _from eagerness for base gain_. In TDNT, it is clear that it is not limited strictly to the economic sphere but rather _gain_ in general. CD defines sordid _gain_ as “to get something that is useful, that gives you an advantage, or that is in some way positive, especially over a period of time.” Also, _see sordid_. Simply shameful gain sordidly.

**Sordid**,
αἰσχρότης (_aischrotēs_):
Eph. 5:4.
Stems from αἰσχρός, which according to Bultmann (TDNT 1:190) means _that which is disgraceful_ also with a strong connotation of <u>shame</u>. Further, Danker defines αἰσχρότης as _shameful conduct_.  CD defines _sordid_ as "morally ugly, so that being involved makes you feel dirty," but also _sordidness_ as "the quality of being dirty and unpleasant," and as "the quality of being morally wrong and shocking."

**Spells**,
see _witchcraft_, another meaning of _pharmakeia_.

**Stealing (act of)**,
κλοπή (_klopē_):
Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:21.
See _thief_, _fraudster_, and _fraud_.

**Thief**,
see _fraudster_, the less secret understanding of _κλέπτης_.

**Timid**,
δειλός (_deilos_):
Rev. 21:8.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree on _timid_. Which is cowardice in relationship to believe for mighty miracles or dying to persecution. It is necessary to overcome human fearfulness in relation to the end-time sufferings under the tribulation. CD defines _timid_ as "shy and nervous; without much confidence; easily frightened."

**Trafficker**,
see _oppressor_, tertiary meaning of _andrapodistēs_.

**Unaffectionate**,
ἄστοργος (_astorgos_):
Rom. 1:31; 2 Tim 3:3.
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich closely agree on _without natural affection_, both T. and Danker support the family sphere. Also, L. in στοργή adds "esp. of parents and children … rarely sexual love." CD defines _unaffectionate_ as "not showing feelings of liking or loving someone."

**Uncommitted**,
ἀσύνθετος (_asynthetos_):
Rom. 1:31.
From Liddell, first we want to understand συντίθημι (A.III), which in a social context denotes "commit to a person's care, deliver to him for his own use or that of others," we also want an understanding of  σύγκειμαι (A.III) that socially connotes "to be agreed on by two parties, … according to what had been agreed on with him." Technically the opposite speaks about two parties being in a covenant, which may also care for each other. Then L. says about ἀσύνθετος _uncompounded_ and _bound by no covenant_, _faithless_. Thayers generally agree in all. Gingrich adds _faithless_,  _untrustworthy_, and _undutiful_. About someone that can not blend with someone else in agreement or covenant because of no affection or affiliation with each other -- they don’t like each other -- and it’s obvious. Predominantly used in the Greek bible between husbands and wives, never in between humans and God, compared to _unfaithful_, ἄπιστος. CD defines _disconnected_ as "separate from someone or something else, and not fitting well together or understanding each other." And, describes _uncommitted_ as "having made no promise to support any particular group, plan, belief, or action." Also, describes _unattached_ as "not feeling connected to a person, group, or idea."

**Unfaithful**,
ἄπιστος (_apistos_):
Rev. 21:8.
The word does exist in Greek both in the secular and Christian sense. According to Bultmann (TDNT 6:175), the original πιστος in the secular sense denotes "_Pistos_. In lit. this first means  a. 'trusting' … Inasmuch as trust may be a duty, _pistos_ can come to have the nuance 'obedient' b. _pistos_ in the sense 'trustworthy' is a word first used in the sphere of sacral law … The expression … denotes the conclusion of a treaty. _ta pista_ is the reliability of those bound by the treaty … 'fidelity' … Similarly _pistos_ ('trustworthy', 'faithful') is used of those who stands in a contractual relation." However, contrary as in the said sense B. (TDNT 6:204-5) describes "_apistos_ … 'faithless' … 'without trust or confidence' … 'unworthy of credence' … _apisteo_ … 'to refuse to believe, … _apistia_ 'unfaithfulness' … 'unbelief'." CD defines _faithless_ as "not loyal and not able to be trusted," and _unfaithful_ as "not loyal or able to be trusted," finally _unbelief_ as "the fact of not having religious belief."

**Ungrateful**,
ἀχάριστος (_acharistos_):
2 Tim. 3:2.
All Liddell, Thayer, Gingrich connotes _ungrateful_, both L. and T. also say _ungracious_. Opposite to χαρίσιος which L. also denotes as _of thanksgiving_, _free gift_. Finally χαρίσ from  L. means . " on the part of the doer, grace, kindness, goodwill, … more freq. on the part of the receiver, sense of favor received, thankfulness, gratitude."
CD defines _gracious_ as "behaving in a pleasant, polite, calm way," But _ungrateful_ as "not showing or expressing thanks, esp. when it is expected or deserved."

**Unmerciful**,
ἀνελεήμων (_aneleēmōn_):
Rom 1:31.
Both Liddell and Thayer  agree in the meaning _merciless_, _without mercy_, while Gingrich and Bultmann (TDNT 2:487) connotes _unmerciful_. It seems that _merciful_ purposes for active merciful conduct while merciless points at lack of compassion related to cruel conduct. While _unmerciful_ aims to hold back merciful conduct, thereby skipping over the poor and needy. CD defines _merciful_ as "someone who is merciful is willing to be kind to and forgive people who are in their power."

**Unrighteousness**,
ἀδικία (_adikia_):
Rom. 1:29.
The word stems from _ἄδικος_, described in TDNT (1:149--57) by Schrenk as a “violator of law,” understood as an opposition against _law_, _rule_, and _customs_. It conceives lawlessness as _legal injustice_, _partiality in judgment_, _unjust rule_, _dishonesty in business_, and _unlawful actions_, which lead to _incompetence_, what is _unjustifiable_, _harm_, and _injury_. It perceives as _calumnious_ and _inimical_, but simply it violates what is _socially acceptable_, _opposes the ethical_, and is _uncivilized_. The CD defines righteousness as “morally correct behavior, or a feeling that you are behaving in a morally correct way.”

**Unscrupulous competition**,
πλεονέκτης (_pleonektēs_):
Eph. 5:5; 1 Cor. 5:10, 11, 6:10.
First, let's explore the core sentiments of πλέον ἔχειν. Delling (TDNT 6:266--7) denotes _having more_, _receiving more_, _wanting more_; after that, it connotes the following: _striving for power_, _to take the greater share_, _to increase one's possessions_, _to seek aggrandizement_, _to take advantage of_, _to seek political gain_; further: _to be in force_, _to be superior_ in number and weapons, _to take precedence_ in power, _to forge ahead_ at the expense of others, _to treat someone arrogantly_. Then the meaning of the term itself. "_pleonektes_ is the 'robber,' … a. 'to be superior' in battle … 'to surpass' in numbers, … 'to be ahead of someone' in goods, right conduct, … 'to excel in something,' of opposite kinds of music, … b. 'to receive more' in material distribution, … 'to be at an advantage' in dealings with gods, … 'to gain' … c. 'to gain advantages,' … 'to take advantage of someone,' … 'to seize the goods of others,' 'to seek something by force,' … 'to do violence to,' laws." Based on distinguishing between _unscrupulous competition_ and _unscrupulous encroaching_, the competition is an active choice and hunt for wealth compared to stealing indifferently from the surroundings of others. Therefore insatiability is a common factor but still different in its approach. We let CD define _unscrupulous_ as "behaving in a way that is dishonest or unfair in order to get what you want," and _competition_ as "a situation in which someone is trying to win something or be more successful than someone else."

**Unscrupulous encroaching**,
πλεονεξία (_pleonexia_):
Mar. 7:22; Rom. 1:29; Eph. 5:3; Col. 3:5.
First, we need to pick up the core sentiment of πλέον ἔχειν by reading _unscrupulous competition_. Then  Delling (TDNT 6:266--7) connotes "_pleonexia_ 'the will to press one's advantage' … The use of _pleonexia_ is more restricted. Formally it is 'excess,' … but the meaning is usually adverse: 'greed,' … 'insatiability' in respect of food and pleasures, … 'immoderation' with … 'desire,' erotically … finally the act of 'encroaching on what belongs to others,' … then esp. the desire for power etc., and esp. the 'urge to assert oneself.'" Finally, we conclude _unscrupulous encroaching_ by letting CD define _encroaching_ as "to take control or possession of something in a gradual way and often without being noticed."

**Uproar**,
ἀκαταστασία (_akatastasia_):
2 Cor. 12:20.
Both Lidell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree that the semantic values of _unruliness_, _unrest_, _disorder_, _disturbance_, _instability_,  _confusion_, _tumult_, and _turmoil_ agrees in an acquainted manner as defined in CD, which defines _uproar_ as "a situation in which a lot of people complain about something angrily or make a lot of noise."

**Vicious**,
ἀνήμερος (_anēmeros_):
2 Tim 3:3.
Both Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree in the meaning _not tame_, _wild_, and _savage_. However, Danker proposes _ferocious_ and _vicious_. CD defines _untamed_ as "left in a natural or wild state." And _vicious_ as "(of an act) intending to hurt badly, or (of a person or animal) likely to be violent."

**Wannabe**,
ἀλαζών (_alazōn_):
Rom. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2.
According to Delling (TDNT 1:226), it denotes the following thing, "makes more of himself," "ascribing to himself either more and better things than he has, or even what he does not possess at all," "promises what he can not perform."  Often in the Greek world, the orator, philosopher, poet, magician, doctor, cook, and officer are called this. Liddell says _vagabond_, _false pretender_, _impostor_, _quack_, _swaggering_. Thayer and Danker add _braggart_ and _boaster_ with L. Most terms don't confluence semantically with what D. describes, or only in part. CD defines _wannabe_ as "a person who wants to be like someone else, esp. someone famous, or who wants to be thought of as famous," but also defines _pretentious_ as "trying to appear or sound more important or clever than you are, especially in matters of art and literature," and "trying to give the appearance of great importance, esp. in a way that is obvious," also _pretender_ as "a person who states they have a right to the high position that someone else has, although other people disagree with this."

**Wine abstinence**,
οἶνος πολύς προσέχω (_oinos polys prosechō_):
1 Tim. 3:8.
All Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich, including Danker, agree on πολύς meaning _great_. Then T. and G. basically denote προσέχω meaning _addicted to_. However, it is strange to prohibit deacons from having heavy addiction if  _drunkenness_ is a sin in general and lower to reach when he belongs higher up than the everyday members of the congregation. Both L. T. and G. agree with _to turn one's mind to_ which is very fortunate from a doctrinal point of view. Instead of focusing on great addiction, a different nuance, based on abstinence, can be addressed. Supposedly it can translate as _greatly turning one's mind to wine_, which would indicate abstinence from frequently drinking wine in smaller portions but without completely controlling it. CD declares _abstinence_ as "the act of not doing something, esp. something that gives you pleasure."

**Wine romp**,
πάροινος (_paroinos_):
1 Tim. 3:3; Tit. 1:7.
According to Thayer and Gingrich, both mention _drunken_ and _wine addiction_. However, this is hard to believe because the average Christian is not supposed to fall into _drunkenness_. It's more probable that the Bishop should be soberer than the average believer in Christ. Then Liddell mentions παροινικός as "addicted to wine, drunken" but there is a whole array of cognates that assert a different behavior,  πάροινος _befitting a drinking party_, _drinking songs_, παροινέω  _play drunken tricks_, παροίνημα _drunkard's butt_, and παροινία _drunken behavior_. However, it seems this is related to imitating frolicsome drunken behavior rather than regular intoxication. Technically this is about a party with happy fellows and an unknown amount of wine. Also, the word πάροινος is incorrectly cited by BibleWorks 10 compared to the real Liddell & Scott. CD defines _romp_ as "a funny, energetic, and often sexual entertainment or situation."

**Witchcraft (use of)**,
φαρμακεία (_pharmakeia_):
Gal. 5:20; Rev. 9:21.
Generally, Thayer, Danker, and Gingrich agree with Liddell on the magic part of φαρμακεία. Then analyzing the cognates thereof in L. gives a whole picture of what φαρμα- means. Firstly φαρμακεία means "the use of _drugs_, _potions_, _spells_, … poisoning, _witchcraft_, … remedy, cure. [italicized on purpose]" Also, "use of _drugs_, esp. of purgatives, … emetics, Arist.Pr.962a3; of _abortifacients_, … generally, the use of any kind of _drugs_, _potions_, or _spells_, … poisoning or _witchcraft_, … metaph., remedy. [italicized on purpose]" Following cognates: φαρμακάω "to suffer from the effect of poison, to be ill or distraught," φαρμακεύς "a poisoner, sorcerer," φαρμακεύω "to administer a drug, … to use enchantments, … to use it as a charm to calm the river, … to drug, give him a poisonous or stupefying drug," φαρμακίς "a sorceress, witch," φάρμακον "a drug, medicine, … medicine for it, remedy against it, … for a head-ache, … in bad sense, an enchanted potion, philtre, so a charm, spell, enchantment, … also a drug, poison, … .a remedy, cure, … of a bridle, … a remedy against," φαρμακοποσία "drinking of medicine, … drinking of poison," φαρμακοπώλης "a dealer in drugs," φαρμακοτρίβης "one who grinds drugs or colors," φαρμακόω "to endue with healing power," φαρμακώδης "of the nature of a φάρμακον, medicinal, … poisonous," φαρμάσσω "to treat by using φάρμακα, … to heal or relieve by medicine, … to bewitch by potions or philtres: hence to bewitch by flattery;" In the day and age of the Greeks it was hard to tell the different between magic and what is to be considered modern day medicine, therefore they confluenced with each other. In Gen. 1:29 God gave herbs for food for humans and animals, which may kind as remedies or cures. The focus is on the evil use, that is, the use of _drugs_ (not medicine), _potions_ (magical), and the use of _spells_, and _abortifacients_, which sums up _witchcraft_.

**Worldly**,
βέβηλος (_bebēlos_):
1 Tim. 1:9; Heb. 12:16.
According to Hauck (TDNT 1:604--5), it means "the place which may be entered by anyone … 'accessible.' It corresponds exactly to the Lat. _profanus_." Further, it denotes "it is used of persons in the sense of 'unsanctified' or 'profane.'" Profane is the use of the world for a vessel that is supposed to be clean and used for holy purposes, therefore it's not allowed to use it for worldly purposes but for holy use in the world. Further from TDNT is "as applied to persons, _bebelos_ in Hb. 12:16 (alongside _pornos_ [i. male-sex-buyer ii. male-prostitute]) … denotes profane men who are far from God; their unholiness includes ethical deficiency in accordance with the NT approach." CD defines _worldly_ as "experienced in the ways of the world," and as "relating to or consisting of physical things and ordinary life rather than spiritual things." When in worldly use, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Wrath**,
ὀργίλος (_orgilos_):
Tit. 1:7.
According to Grether/Fichtner (TDNT 5:410), said term denotes "They mean 'wrathful,' 'angry,' and … they are used only for the human attribute." Thus it stands in relationship to _rage_ and _revenge_ with the difference of inner disposition. _Wrath_ happens between the offense and the outburst of rage or revenge. CD defines _anger_ as "a strong feeling that makes you want to hurt someone or be unpleasant because of something unfair or unkind that has happened," and _wrath_ as "extreme anger." Also see _rage_.
