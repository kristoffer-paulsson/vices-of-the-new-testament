## Vices

The vices described in the entries in the following list are compiled from: Gal. 5:19–21; Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:21; Rom. 1:29–31; 1 Tim. 1:9–10, 2:8–10, 3:3–11, 3:13; Eph. 4:31, 5:3–5; 2 Tim. 3:2–3; 1 Cor. 5:10–11, 6:9–10; 2 Cor. 12:20–21; Tit. 1:7, 2:3, 3:3, 3:9; Col. 3:5, 3:8–9; Heb. 12:15, 12:16, 13:4; 1 Pet. 2:1, 4:3; Acts 15:20, 15:29, 21:25; Rev. 9:20–21, 21:8, 21:27, 22:15;

**Unrighteousness**,
ἀδικία (_adikia_):
Rom. 1:29;
The word stems from _ἄδικος_, described in TDNT (1:149–57) by Schrenk as a “violator of law,” understood as an opposition against _law_, _rule_, and _customs_. It conceives lawlessness as _legal injustice_, _partiality in judgment_, _unjust rule_, _dishonesty in business_, and _unlawful actions_, which lead to _incompetence_, what is _unjustifiable_, _harm_, and _injury_. It perceives as _calumnious_ and _inimical_, but simply it violates what is _socially acceptable_, _opposes the ethical_, and is _uncivilized_. The CD defines righteousness as “morally correct behavior, or a feeling that you are behaving in a morally correct way.”

**Blood**,
αἷμα (_haima_):
Acts 15:20, 29, 21:25; 
Behm (TDNT 1:172) says that the core physiological meaning is _blood_. Liddell also points to _streams of blood_, _bloodshed_, and _blood-relationship_. Gingrich adds _bloody deeds_, the blood of animals used for _cultic purposes_ or _purification_. All in contrast to the shed blood of Jesus Christ for our sins and salvific use. Thus Christians are to abstain and keep from bloody use except for slaughter in meat production by pouring it straight out the drain and nothing else. Because the life is in the blood and dedicated for the use at the altar, thus it is prohibited to eat it in Lev. 17:11-14. The CD defines _blood_ as “the red liquid that is sent around the body by the heart, and carries oxygen and important substances to organs and tissue, and removes waste products.”

**Sectarianism**,
αἵρεσις (_hairesis_):
Gal. 5:20;
Danker describes it as a choice of association based on shared principles or beliefs, ordinarily of a subgroup with views or beliefs that deviate in certain respects from those of a larger party. Usually, there are religious or schismatic sects that rise in heresy and cause divisions in the Body of Christ contrary to the gospel. Schlier (TDNT 1:181) adds that αἵρεσις denotes names for both _teachings_ and _schools_. For a group to exist the required aspects are usually a comprehensive gathering in the group, a self-chosen authority of a teacher, and an authoritarian doctrine that is well-disputable compared to the Word of God. Thayer inclines that the verb form αἱρέω denotes _the act of taking capture_, _the storming of a city_. From that, it’s conclusive that unnecessary divisions in a group are about making a coup based on disputably misunderstood teachings. CD defines _sectarianism_ as “very strong support for the religious or political group that you are a member of, which can cause problems between different groups.”

**Sordid gain**,
αἰσχροκερδής (_aischrokerdēs_):
1 Tim. 3:8; Tit. 1:7;
Stems from two words: αἰσχρός _sordid_, and κέρδος, which according to Schlier (TDNT 3:672) means _to gain_, _advantage_, _profit_, also _crafty counsels_ and _cunning_. Further, Liddell states: _sordidly greedy for gain_, and Thayer states: _from eagerness for base gain_. In TDNT, it is clear that it is not limited strictly to the economic sphere but rather _gain_ in general. CD defines sordid _gain_ as “to get something that is useful, that gives you an advantage, or that is in some way positive, especially over a period of time.” Also, _see sordid_. Simply shameful gain sordidly.

**Sordid calumny**,
αἰσχρολογία (_aischrologia_):
Col. 3:8;
Stems from two words: αἰσχρός _sordid_, and λόγος which according to Debrunner (TDNT 4:73) aims for _assembling_, _reckoning_, _account_, _review_, and _narrative_. Delling (TDNT 4:4) describes the contrast of καταλαλιά which is: "evil report" and "calumny" as "malicious or unthinking gossip." Thereby sordid accusations or evil thought-through slander cunningly planted. CD defines sordid _calumny_ as "(the act of making) a statement about someone that is not true and is intended to damage the reputation of that person." Also, _see sordid_. Simply shameful calumny sordidly.

**Sordid**,
αἰσχρότης (_aischrotēs_):
Eph. 5:4;
Stems from αἰσχρός, which according to Bultmann (TDNT 1:190) means _that which is disgraceful_ also with a strong connotation of <u>shame</u>. Further, Danker defines αἰσχρότης as _shameful conduct_.  CD defines _sordid_ as "morally ugly, so that being involved makes you feel dirty," but also _sordidness_ as "the quality of being dirty and unpleasant," and as "the quality of being morally wrong and shocking."

**Ravagery**,
ἀκαθαρσία, ἀκάθαρτος, (_akatharsia_, _akathartos_):
Gal. 5:19; Eph. 5:3; 2 Cor. 12:21; Col. 3:5; Eph. 5:5;
LXX denotes those terms in the context of impurity on the outside, usually from: certain animals and similar, corpses, bodily issues, semen, menstruation and other types of discharges from the body. Ordinarily, it has been described in bible translations using words such as: impure, unclean, and abominable. Totally, every sort of uncleanliness in the Pentateuch is associated with outward filth as _contagious_. Being contagious in the OT law is not a sin. However, it is a sin (Lev. 5:2) not to keep track of contamination under mosaic law. Jesus, however, declares all food clean (Mat. 15:16–20), and thereby there is no cultic impurity within ἀκαθαρσία. However, concurrently Jesus declares that it is what goes out from the heart through the mouth that defiles man, among others ἀκαθαρσία. Peter is given the revelation (Acts 10:28) to not call anyone contagious as in impure to the Jews. It is said that ἀκάθαρτος is about being unclean, but systematically through the NT, it mentions unclean spirits as contagious. ἀκαθαρσία on the other hand is used systematically with ravage and other filthy conduct. Technically, the kind of filth that goes out from the heart through the mouth – which causes ravage in the social and economical sphere – and is thereby associated with backbiting and severe revenge, with similar conduct. DC defines _ravage_ as "to cause great damage to something or someone."

**Uproar**,
ἀκαταστασία (_akatastasia_):
2 Cor. 12:20;
Both Lidell, Thayer, and Gingrich agree that the semantic values of _unruliness_, _unrest_, _disorder_, _disturbance_, _instability_,  _confusion_, _tumult_, and _turmoil_ agrees in an acquainted manner as defined in CD, which defines _uproar_ as "a situation in which a lot of people complain about something angrily or make a lot of noise."

**Dissipated**,
ἀκρατής (_akratēs_):
2 Tim. 3:3;
Liddell, Thayer, and Gingrich are confluent in the following terms: _immoderate_, _without self-control_, _intemperate_, _dissolute_. CD defines _dissipated_ as "spending too much time enjoying physical pleasures and harmful activities such as drinking a lot of alcohol."

**Wannabe**,
ἀλαζών (_alazōn_):
Rom. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2;
According to Delling (TDNT 1:226), it denotes the following thing, "makes more of himself," "ascribing to himself either more and better things than he has, or even what he does not possess at all," "promises what he can not perform."  Often in the Greek world, the orator, philosopher, poet, magician, doctor, cook, and officer are called this. Liddell says _vagabond_, _false pretender_, _impostor_, _quack_, _swaggering_. Thayer and Danker add _braggart_ and _boaster_ with L. Most terms don't confluence semantically with what D. describes, or only in part. CD defines _wannabe_ as "a person who wants to be like someone else, esp. someone famous, or who wants to be thought of as famous," but also defines _pretentious_ as "trying to appear or sound more important or clever than you are, especially in matters of art and literature," and "trying to give the appearance of great importance, esp. in a way that is obvious," also _pretender_ as "a person who states they have a right to the high position that someone else has, although other people disagree with this."

**Sinner**,
ἁμαρτωλός (_hamartōlos_):
1 Tim. 1:9;
According to Rengstorf (TDNT 1:317), ἁμαρτωλός denotes the core connotation as ἁμαρτία which is “not hitting,” “missing,” “the man who misses something,” and ἁμαρτωλός specifically "sinner," “when he misses something.” Except that there is no satisfying or distinguishing utility to explain such properly. Here we must explicitly rely on the context of 1 Tim. 1:9. The context says that the mosaic law is for those sinners but can impossibly refer to sinners of the mosaic law itself. Therefore only the Law of Christ (1 Cor. 9:21, Gal. 6:2) in the NT can be applicable (Mat. 22:35–40, John 13:24). When failing to do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Oppressor**,
ἀνδραποδιστής (_andrapodistēs_):
1 Tim. 1:10;
According to Liddell and Gingrich, both say _kidnapper_ and _slave-dealer_, Thayer goes further and explains "(from ἀνδραποδίζω, and this from τό ἀνδράποδον – from ἀνήρ and πούς – a slave, a man taken in war and sold into slavery), a _slave-dealer_, _kidnapper_, _man-stealer_, i. e. as well one who unjustly reduces free men to slavery, as one who steals the slaves of others and sells them." CD defines _oppressor_ as "someone who treats people in an unfair and cruel way and prevents them from having opportunities and freedom." Further, _kidnapper_ as "someone who takes a person away illegally by force, usually in order to demand money in exchange for releasing them." Finally, _trafficker_ as "a person who buys and sells goods or people illegally." If anyone oppresses, kidnaps, or traffics somebody, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the oppression, including proven sound before the congregational elders.

**Kidnapper**,
see _oppressor_, secondary meaning of _andrapodistēs_.

**Trafficker**,
see _oppressor_, tertiary meaning of _andrapodistēs_.

**Husband-murderer**,
ἀνδροφόνος (_androphonos_):
1 Tim 1:9;
Liddell describes "[1)] man-slaying ... [2)] of women, murdering husbands." Manslayer is a crime of the worst sort. May the person doing this – if a woman – repent, and may her children forgive her. If a wife kills her husband, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented from it, including proven sound before the congregational elders.

**Xyz**,
ἀνελεήμων (_aneleēmōn_):
Rom 1:31;

**Xyz**,
ἀνήμερος (_anēmeros_):
2 Tim 3:3;

**Xyz**,
ἀνόητος (_anoētos_):
Tit. 3:3;

**Lawless**,
ἄνομος (_anomos_):
1 Tim. 1:9;
According to Gutbrod (TDNT 4:1086), the meaning is “having no law.” In 1 Cor. 9:21, Paul instructs: “I become lawless unto the lawless – I am not without God’s law but legal in Christ – to gain those without any law (NA28; my translation).” Technically even if Paul gained those without law by adapting to them, he never overlooked the Law of Christ. The big problem arises when someone disregards the worldly and the divine law simultaneously and thus becomes truly lawless. When people do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not become lawful.

**Impious**,
ἀνόσιος (_anosios_):
1 Tim. 1:9; 2 Tim. 3:2;
According to Hauck (TDNT 5:492), mentions "...it occurs twice in the Past. for 'impious' persons who impiously reject sacred obligations. ... but in 2 Tim. 3:2 the sequence ... suggests the sense of 'impious,' 'devoid of piety.'" It seems that the difference to _irreverent_ is rather the skipping or negligence of basic NT biblical obligations to one's relatives and family prescribed by Jesus as expected in Christian conduct. CD defined _piety_ as "a strong belief in God or a religion, shown by your worship and behavior." When failing to do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Rebellious**,
ἀνυπότακτος (_anypotaktos_):
1 Tim. 1:9;
According to Delling (TDNT 8:47), it denotes “not subject,” “free,” and “not subjected to specific (here geographical) ideas.” It means exactly “‘not subjecting’ oneself to sound teaching or its proponents (Tit. 1:9–10).” Also, in context “‘not submissive’ either in practice or principle. Here too, as in current usage, it has the sense of ‘rebellious’ or ‘refractory’ against God’s will (1 Tim. 1:9).” According to CD, _refractory_ is “not affected by a treatment, change, or process.” Also, _rebellious_ is defined as “If a group of people are rebellious, they oppose the ideas of the people in authority and plan to change the system, often using force.” When people rebel, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not submit.

**Xyz**,
ἀπειθής (_apeithēs_):
Rom. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2; Tit. 3:3;

**Xyz**,
ἄπιστος (_apistos_):
Rev. 21:8;

**Xyz**,
ἅρπαξ (_harpax_):
1 Cor. 5:10, 11, 6:10;

**Gay-partner**,
ἀρσενοκοίτης (_arsenokoitēs_):
1 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 6:9;
Thayer connotes "(ἄρσην a male; κοίτη a bed), one who lies with a male as with a female, a sodomite." Technically this is about man-gay sex, but it seems that it can interpret differently if the combining words are more deeply understood. See _nests (multiple)_ to connote the word κοίτη as singular, generally about cohabiting. Generally speaking, it is two men, a husband being sexually cohabited by a male, technically gay partnership. CD defines _civil partnership_ as "in the UK, a legal relationship between two people of the same sex that gives them the same rights as people who are married." Also, _partner_ as "the person you are married to or living with as if married to them, or the person you are having a sexual relationship with."

**Irreverent**,
ἀσεβής (_asebēs_):
1 Tim. 1:9;
According to Foerster (TDNT 7:185–7), for the pagans, irreverence meant "In Athenian trials for _asebia_ non-belief in the gods in which the _polis_ believes is called _adikein_ ... all private cults are to be forbidden under the law of _asebia_... As long as the ancient _polis_ endured _asebia_, the failure to worship the city gods, was a breach of its order. Taking part in the national cult was _eusebeia_, refusal to do so _asebeia_. To the end of antiquity, then, an important part of _eusebeia_ or _asebeia_ was participation in the national cult or refusal to do this." Also, for the pagans, "As _eusebeia_ developed from reverence for the gods and the orders protected by them to worship of the gods, so _asebeia_ developed from a lack of reverence for the gods  to neglect of the cultus." For the Jews, irreverence could be "With _asebes_ there is never any more precise indication of obj. This does not mean that only God is the direct object of _aseb-_. A first pt. to notice is that _aseb-_ never denotes a mere attitude but always action, conduct. Hence _asebeia_ can often be put in the plur. as issue of specific acts. If the obj. is indicated only with the verb _asebeo_, this is the more surprising in that the group is not used only for cultic or particularly religious acts. A false witness speaks _asebeia_ ... _asebes_ means one who is guilty in the judgement ... _asebeo_ means transgression of judicial directions." CD defines _irreverent_ as "lacking the expected respect for official, important, or holy things." Biblically _irreverent_ means conduct against God that is not worthy to call worship, because their hands do not conduct what their tongues confess (Jam 1: 22–25). When failing to do so, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Worldly**,
βέβηλος (_bebēlos_):
1 Tim. 1:9; Heb. 12:16;
According to Hauck (TDNT 1:604–5), it means "the place which may be entered by anyone ... 'accessible.' It corresponds exactly to the Lat. _profanus_." Further, it denotes "it is used of persons  in the sense of 'unsanctified' or 'profane.'" Profane is the use of the world for a vessel that is supposed to be clean and used for holy purposes, therefore it's not allowed to use it for worldly purposes but for holy use in the world. Further from TDNT is "as applied to persons, _bebelos_ in Hb. 12:16 (alongside _pornos_ [whoremaster]) ... denotes profane men who are far from God; their unholiness includes ethical deficiency in accordance with the NT approach." CD defines _worldly_ as "experienced in the ways of the world," and as "relating to or consisting of physical things and ordinary life rather than spiritual things." When in worldly use, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away from it.

**Blasphemy**,
βλασφημία, βλάσφημος (_blasphēmia_, _blasphēmos_):
Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:22; Eph 4:31; Col 3:8; 1 Tim. 3:13; 2 Tim. 3:2;
The word group, according to Beyer (TDNT 1:621–25), means "abusive speech," "word of evil sound," "The word means further the strongest form of 'personal mockery and calumniation,'" but weaker than _defamatory_. CD defines _mockery_ as "the act of mocking someone or something," and _blaspheme_ as "to use offensive words or make statements that show no respect for God or religion." It's usually translated as _blasphemy_ when used against God but as _mockery_ when against humans.

**Mockery**,
see _blasphemy_, rather used against humans than God.

**Slander**,
καταλαλιά, κατάλαλος (_katalalia_, _katalalos_):
2 Cor. 12:20; 1 Pet. 2:1; Rom. 1:30;
This word group, according to Kittel (TDNT 4:4), stands in contrast to _sordid calumny_ as _unthinking gossip_ as the big difference. Except that it is "to importune someone with speeches," "to prattle something to someone," and also "to speak against, to accuse, someone," but is most likely common everyday slander. CD defines _slander_ as "statements that someone makes about another person that are not true and that harm their reputation, or the crime of making these statements."

**Xyz**,
κλέμμα (_klemma_):
Rev. 9:21;

**Xyz**,
κλέπτης (_kleptēs_):
1 Cor. 6:10;

**Xyz**,
κλοπή (_klopē_):
Mat. 15:19; Mar. 7:21;

**Xyz**,
κοινός (_koinos_):
Rev. 21:27;

**Nests (multiple), polygamy**,
κοίταις (_koitais_, plural):
Rom 13:13;
κοίτη in singular according to Liddell means among others: _bedstead_, _marriage-bed_, _of one dead_, _lair_ of a wild beast, a _nest_ of a bird, of the spider, of the fish, _pen_, _fold_ for cattle, _act of going to bed_, _of sexual connection_. A very related word of Liddell is κοῖτος which means: _resting-place_, _bed of birds_, _stall_, _fold_, _pen_.  κοίτη itself should not be mistaken for sinful conduct but is used regarding many righteous men and women in the bible, even if not married. It is conclusive that κοίτη originally was about the nightly protection in the era of the stone-age. Animals and people pursued a nightly place to live and defend. Some animals live in pairs and build a common κοίτη. The same thing with humans a man and woman cooperate for nightly protection, and around that place, builds or furnish what they call home. Technically it’s a shared bed around which the whole household builds up. Think of it from the point of view of a birdnest, two birds builds a nest in which they mate, lay eggs, raises chicks, and sleep in it, everything contrary to other animals that do not have a monogamous relationship with their peers. In 2 Sam. 11:13, Uriah goes back to his _nest_ to sleep for the second time – the LXX uses the word κοίτη here. In Gen. 49:4, Reuben did climb his father Israel's _nest_ by sleeping with his wife. Rom. 9:10 says "not only but except even Rebecca out of one _nest_ conceived, with our father Isaac (NA28; my translation)." Technically κοίτη as _nest_ is in itself normal human conduct. However, with many cohabitations – wedded or not – it’s sinful polygamy. CD defines _nest as_ "to build a nest, or live in a nest," and "a structure or other place where creatures, esp. birds, give birth or leave their eggs to develop." Also, CD defines _polygamy_ as "the custom or condition of being married to more than one person at the same time."

**Xyz**,
κραυγή (_kraugē_):
Eph. 4:31;

**Xyz**,
κῶμος (_kōmos_):
Gal. 5:21; 1 Pet. 4:3;

**Defamatory**,
λοίδορος (_loidoros_):
1 Cor. 5:11, 6:10;
According to Hanse (TDNT 4:293–4), it may include _reproach_, _insult_, _revile_, and even _blaspheme_. However, _defamation_ takes over where _mockery_ ends and denotes "The idea that abuse which injures the reputation is a preliminary form of murder...," thereby it is a form of persecution that the reviler practices, and which believers are said not to hang around this type of persons. CD defines _defamatory_ as "damaging the reputation of a person or group by saying or writing bad things about them that are not true." Simply the one who persecutes by defamatory means.

**Xyz**,
μαλακός (_malakos_):
1 Cor. 6:9;

**Xyz**,
μάχη (_machē_):
Tit. 3:9;

**Xyz**,
μέθη (_methē_):

**Xyz**,
μέθυσος (_methysos_):
1 Cor. 5:11, 6:10;

**Mother-murderer**,
μητρολῴας (_mētrolōas_):

Liddell describes "striking one's mother, a matricide." CD describes _matricide_ as "a crime in which a person kills their mother." If anyone kills their mother, they have committed murder. If anyone kills their parent, they should fall out of the Grace of God unto the jurisdiction of the mosaic law. Not until fully repented of the thing, including proven sound before the congregational elders.

According to Hauck/Schulz (TDNT 6:580), "_porne_ from _pernemi_ 'to sell,' esp. of slaves, means lit. 'harlot for hire,' 'prostitute'; Gk. harlots were usually bought slaves ... _pornos_ ... 'whoremonger' who has intercourse with prostitutes then specifically one who lets himself be used for money, 'male prostitute' ... _porneia_ ... rare in class Gk., 'fornication' ... _moicheuo_ is narrower than _porneia_ and refers solely to adultery." According to Liddell the following words beginning with πορν- means: πορνεία _prostitution_, πορνεῖον _brothel_, πορνεύω "_prostitute_, mostly in Pass., of a woman, _prostitute herself, be or become a prostitute_," πόρνη "_harlot_, _prostitute_," πορνικός "_of or for harlots_, ... the tax _paid by brothel-keepers_," πορνοβοσκέω "_keep a brothel_," πορνοβοσκία "_trade of a brothel-keeper_," πορνοβοσκός _brothel-keeper_, πορνοφίλας or πορνο-φίλης "_loving-harlots_," πορνο-διδάσκαλος "_teacher of fornication_", πορνο-γέννητος "_born of harlots_," πορνο-γράφος "_wiritng of harlots_," πορνο-κοπέω "_to be a whoremonger_," πορνο-κοπία _whoremongering_, πορνο-κόπος "_one who has commerce with prostitutes_, _fornicator_," πορνο-μανής "_mad after prostitutes_," πόρνος "_catamite_, _sodomite_, _fornicator_," πορνο-τελώνης "_farmer of the_ [brothel], _tax-gatherer_." A lot of bible translations use the word _fornication_ which stems from the Latin. Lewis & Short says: fornix "_a brothel, bagnio, stew_, situated in underground vaults," fornĭcātĭo "_whoredom_, _fornication_," fornĭcātor _fornicator_, fornĭcor "_to commit whoredom_ or _fornication_," fornĭcātrix "_a fornicatress, prostitute." It is clear that _fornication_ comes from _prostitution_, and everything related to πορν- is brothel activity and nothing else. Therefore it should be obvious that πορνεία is the activity of a man paying for the performance of prostitutive acts and nothing else. Prostitution has come to be a derogatory term for those not practicing brothel activity but those that refuse religious _sexual asceticism_ and similar. CD defines _prostitution_ as "the business of having sex for money." (It seems like CD has removed the act of buying a prostitute from the dictionary.)

**Sex-purchase**,
see _prostitution_.

**Male-sex-buyer**,
πόρνος (_pornos_):
1 Tim. 1:10; Eph. 5:5; 1 Cor. 5:10, 11, 6:9; Heb. 12:16, 13:4;
According to Hauck/Schulz (TDNT 6:580), "_pornos_ ... 'whoremonger' who has intercourse with prostitutes then specifically one who lets himself be used for money, 'male prostitute'" There is no word in CD regarding male sexual immoral conduct. When men purchase sex, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not turn away and repent for it.

**Male-prostitute**,
see _male-sex-buyer_, secondary meaning of _pornos_.

**Liar**,
ψεύστης (_pseustēs_):
1 Tim. 1:10;
In John 14:6, we need to know that Jesus claims to be the truth with capital T. In John 8:44, The Devil is the father of lies with capital L. Technically, the term ψεύστης is used only 10 times in the NT, mostly by John and secondly by Paul. It is only used in contrast between the  truth of God and the lies of the Devil. All truthfulness is in regard to the Kingdom of God and Jesus with the Gospel. Conzelmann (TDNT 9:594) denotes the correct use of ψεύστης in profane greek as _liar_. But the meaning thereof is far away from protestant and catholic state religious connotation, instead, C. describes "Lying cannot be viewed merely as the opposite of truth. Basic to the general and philosophical use of the word group is the twofold sense, namely, objective and subjective appearance, untruth as non-breaking and error as false judgment of reality. The norm of the ethical assessment of lying is the firm bond between _aletheia_ and _dike_. At issue is the divinely protected order of the world." Further, C. states "Hence the worst lie is perjury ... Subj. values enter in here. Lying esp. direct lying against others i.e., 'calumniation' _diabole_, is alien to the good man ... It deprives honor and is an assault on human dignity ... The aristocratic order demands esp. that one should not deceive those to whom one owes respect, ... On the other hand the gods deceive (_dolos_) men." CD describes _lie_ as "to say or write something that is not true in order to deceive someone," and _liar_ as "someone who tells lies." When lying, it is applicable to fall away from the Grace of God into the mosaic jurisdiction if they do not stop it.

## Grace Exclusion
The following sins mentioned in 1 Tim. 1:9–10 will make you fall from grace in under the mosaic jurisdiction if not turned away from.

## Heavenly Exclusion
The following sins mentioned in Gal. 5:19–21; Eph. 5:5; 1 Cor. 6:9–10; Rev. 21:8, 27, 22:15; will exclude you from entering heaven if you live by them at the moment of fatality. Therefore get rid of them out of your life immediately, and promise yourself to never come by them again.
