Presumably **Common**, κοινός (koinos) should be removed as a sin of heavenly exclusion. Koinos is a state of 
commonization which happens if certain sins are practiced (Matt 15:19; Mark 7:21-22). However, Revelations 21:27 
mentions that what is koinos (defiled) will not enter into the Heavenly Jerusalem. If persons that are koinos won't 
ever come into the new Jerusalem that means all the gentiles of the world are automatically saved because they are not 
supposed to be called koinos. in Acts 10:15 also v.29. Therefore, we will consider koinos a state, not a sin and being 
the defilement and not persons being excluded from New Jerusalem if someone still has their name in the Book of Life 
of the Lamb!  

The entry **Profane**, βέβηλος (bebēlos) should be more strict and less generalized. Profaning is related to a 
woman profaning herself by prostitution (Lev 21:9) in the OT and thereby profaning her father. In the NT (Heb 12:6) 
Esau lost his inheritance due to a profane lifestyle where also **male-sex-buyer/seller** is mentioned.
Another view of **profane** is spoken profanity, (1 Tim 4:7) _βεβήλους καὶ γραώδεις μύθους_ which warns for ungodly 
old ladies fables. Also in 1 Tim 6:20; 2 Tim 2:16 mentioning _βεβήλους κενοφωνίας_, as chatter of maybe sex slander 
in terms of whoredom. Simply bebēlos should be strongly narrowed down presumably only in the sexual arena relatively to
prostitution and similar.

<s>More can be added to **Abominable**, βδελύσσομαι (bdelyssomai). the analysis should go deeper, there are accompanying 
information mentioned in the TDNT that should be valued and summed up, also a deeper understanding of the grammar of
the participle verb should be analyzed, added perfect aspect and middle tense. By hermeneutically analyzing the word use
around the bible, first it begins with the unsanitary which then defiles someone who becomes abhorred / the abominable.
However, it seems it is the ones that practiced abhorring against others in the past. Maybe change to **Abhorrers**.</s>

When it comes to **Abomination**, βδέλυγμα (bdelygma), it should be complemented with Luke 15:16, about the pharisees 
being an abomination because they justify themselves before men pridefully.

Presumably **Brutal (violence)**, ἀσέλγεια (aselgeia), should only use _brutal_ as it's upper boundary and have a range
of riotous living as it's lower boundary.

Most likely **Erotic perversion**, πάθος (pathos), is not about kink or perversion per say.
In order to make that conclusion there is the necessity to addhere to extrabiblical sources.
Now pathos is used three times with a clear sexual connection but in all instances it's just a
one word of a phrase. Those are used in Rom 1:26, Col 3:5, and 1 Thess 4:5. At the said place
in Romans the phrase _πάθη ἀτιμίας_ which likely translates to _passions of disgrace_ is used in
a context of God's twisting of peoples libido as in trans, queer and male gay behaviour.
In Col 3:5 presumably the phrase _πάθος ἐπιθυμίαν_ could mean _passions of cravings_,
but in Thess 4:5 _πάθει ἐπιθυμίας_ is used too. However, 4:5--7 Puts this into context,
this is about men rivaling for women based on their lustful cravings and in that also commit
the sins of _πλεονεκτέω_ and later _ἀκαθαρσία_. Both those words are also mentioned in
Col 3:5 and thereby it may refer to the same behaviors in the last mentioned contexts.
Presumably the post should be renamed __romantic rivalry__.
