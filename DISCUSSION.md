Presumably **Common**, κοινός (koinos) should be removed as a sin of heavenly exclusion. Koinos is a state of 
commonization which happens if certain sins are practiced (Matt 15:19; Mark 7:21-22). However, Revelations 21:27 
mentions that what is koinos (defiled) will not enter into the Heavenly Jerusalem. If persons that are koinos won't 
ever come into the new Jerusalem that means all the gentiles of the world are automatically saved because they are not 
supposed to be called koinos. in Acts 10:15 also v.29. Therefore, we will consider koinos a state, not a sin and being 
the defilement and not persons being excluded from New Jerusalem if someone still has their name in the Book of Life 
of the Lamb!  

The entry **Profane**, βέβηλος (bebēlos) should be more strict and less generalized. Profaning is related to a 
woman profaning herself by prostitution (Lev 21:9) in the OT and thereby profaning her father. In the NT (Heb 12:6) 
Esau lost his inheritance due to a profane lifestyle where also **male-sex-buyer/seller** is mentioned.
Another view of **profane** is spoken profanity, (1 Tim 4:7) _βεβήλους καὶ γραώδεις μύθους_ which warns for ungodly 
old ladies fables. Also in 1 Tim 6:20; 2 Tim 2:16 mentioning _βεβήλους κενοφωνίας_, as chatter of maybe sex slander 
in terms of whoredom. Simply bebēlos should be strongly narrowed down presumably only in the sexual arena relatively to
prostitution and similar.

<s>More can be added to **Abominable**, βδελύσσομαι (bdelyssomai). the analysis should go deeper, there are accompanying 
information mentioned in the TDNT that should be valued and summed up, also a deeper understanding of the grammar of
the participle verb should be analyzed, added perfect aspect and middle tense. By hermeneutically analyzing the word use
around the bible, first it begins with the unsanitary which then defiles someone who becomes abhorred / the abominable.
However, it seems it is the ones that practiced abhorring against others in the past. Maybe change to **Abhorrers**.</s>

When it comes to **Abomination**, βδέλυγμα (bdelygma), it should be complemented with Luke 15:16, about the pharisees 
being an abomination because they justify themselves before men pridefully.

Presumably **Brutal (violence)**, ἀσέλγεια (aselgeia), should only use _brutal_ as it's upper boundary and have a range
of riotous living as it's lower boundary.
