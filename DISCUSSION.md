Presumably **Common**, κοινός (koinos) should be removed as a sin of heavenly exclusion. Koinos is a state of 
commonization which happens if certain sins are practiced (Matt 15:19; Mark 7:21-22). However, Revelations 21:27 
mentions that what is koinos (defiled) will not enter into the Heavenly Jerusalem. If persons that are koinos won't 
ever come into the new Jerusalem that means all the gentiles of the world are automatically saved because they are not 
supposed to be called koinos. in Acts 10:15 also v.29. Therefore, we will consider koinos a state, not a sin and being 
the defilement and not persons being excluded from New Jerusalem if someone still has their name in the Book of Life 
of the Lamb!
